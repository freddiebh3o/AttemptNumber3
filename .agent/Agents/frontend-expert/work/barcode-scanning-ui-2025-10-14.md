## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Chose html5-qrcode Library
- **What**: Selected html5-qrcode over @zxing/browser for barcode scanning
- **Why**:
  - Better iOS Safari support (critical for mobile warehouse staff)
  - Simpler API with clear documentation
  - Active maintenance and community support
  - Handles multiple barcode formats (EAN13, UPCA, CODE128, QR)
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **@zxing/browser**: More features but complex API and iOS issues
  - **quagga2**: Limited format support
- **Chosen Approach**: html5-qrcode because it prioritizes mobile compatibility and simplicity

### Decision 2: Full-Screen Modal vs Inline Scanning
- **What**: Implemented full-screen modal for barcode scanning
- **Why**:
  - Maximizes camera viewfinder size for better scanning accuracy
  - Focuses user attention on scanning task
  - Prevents accidental navigation away
  - Mobile-first design pattern
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Inline scanner**: Less immersive, harder to scan on small screens
  - **Separate page**: More navigation overhead
- **Chosen Approach**: Full-screen modal for best mobile UX

### Decision 3: Manual Entry Fallback
- **What**: Added manual barcode entry mode as fallback
- **Why**:
  - Camera permissions may be denied
  - USB barcode scanners are common in warehouses
  - Accessibility requirement
  - Handles edge cases gracefully
- **Implementation**: Toggle button switches between camera and text input modes

### Decision 4: Scanned Items State Management
- **What**: Store scanned items in local component state (not Zustand)
- **Why**:
  - Scanning session is ephemeral and modal-scoped
  - No need for cross-component state sharing
  - Simpler implementation
  - Avoids state cleanup on modal close
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Zustand store**: Overkill for temporary scanning state
  - **React Query**: Not needed for local-only state
- **Chosen Approach**: Local useState for simplicity

### Decision 5: Audio and Haptic Feedback
- **What**: Implemented beep sound and vibration on successful scans
- **Why**:
  - Instant user feedback without looking at screen
  - Standard warehouse scanning UX pattern
  - Reduces user uncertainty
  - Improves scanning efficiency
- **Implementation**: Web Audio API for beep, navigator.vibrate() for haptic

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

**Barcode Scanning Flow:**
1. User clicks "Scan to Receive" button on transfer detail page
2. BarcodeScannerModal opens full-screen
3. html5-qrcode initializes camera with rear-facing mode
4. User scans product barcode with camera
5. Component calls `getProductByBarcodeApiRequest()` to lookup product
6. Validates product is in the transfer and not fully received
7. Adds/increments item in scanned items list
8. Plays audio beep and triggers vibration
9. User reviews scanned items (qty, expected, status indicators)
10. User clicks "Receive All Scanned Items"
11. Component calls existing `receiveStockTransferApiRequest()` with bulk items
12. Modal closes and transfer refreshes

**Camera Integration:**
```typescript
const scanner = new Html5Qrcode(readerElementId);
await scanner.start(
  { facingMode: "environment" }, // Rear camera
  { fps: 10, qrbox: { width: 250, height: 250 } },
  handleBarcodeScanned,
  undefined
);
```

**Barcode Lookup:**
```typescript
const response = await getProductByBarcodeApiRequest({
  barcode,
  branchId: transfer.destinationBranchId,
});
```

### Algorithms & Logic

**Scanned Items Aggregation:**
- Maintains array of scanned items with `productId` as key
- On barcode scan, checks if product already in list
- If exists: increments `qtyScanned`
- If new: adds to list with `qtyScanned: 1`
- Tracks `qtyExpected` from transfer items for comparison

**Status Indicators:**
- **Complete** (green): `qtyScanned === qtyExpected`
- **Over** (orange): `qtyScanned > qtyExpected`
- **Partial** (blue): `qtyScanned < qtyExpected`

**Validation:**
- Product must exist in current transfer (validates against `transfer.items`)
- Product must not be fully received (`qtyShipped - qtyReceived > 0`)
- Over-receiving triggers confirmation modal

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Camera permission denied**:
   - Shows error alert
   - Automatically switches to manual entry mode

2. **Barcode not found**:
   - Shows error notification
   - Does not add to scanned items

3. **Product not in transfer**:
   - Shows specific error: "Product X is not in this transfer"
   - Prevents accidental cross-transfer receiving

4. **Already fully received**:
   - Shows warning notification
   - Does not add to scanned items

5. **Over-receiving**:
   - Shows orange status badge
   - Displays warning notification
   - Requires confirmation before submit

6. **Rapid duplicate scans**:
   - Debounced via `isLookingUp` flag
   - Prevents double-counting

7. **Scanner cleanup**:
   - Properly stops camera on modal close
   - Clears scanner instance
   - Prevents memory leaks

8. **Manual entry mode**:
   - Supports keyboard input
   - Supports USB barcode scanner (acts as keyboard)
   - Enter key triggers lookup

### Performance Considerations

- **Camera FPS**: Limited to 10 FPS to balance accuracy and performance
- **Debouncing**: Prevents duplicate scans within 200ms
- **Lazy camera start**: Camera only starts when modal opens
- **Proper cleanup**: Camera stops when modal closes to conserve battery
- **Optimistic UI**: Shows scanned items immediately, validation happens async

### Security Considerations

- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Barcode lookup filtered by `currentTenantId` from session
- **Permission check**: Requires `stock:write` permission
- **Branch membership**: User must be member of destination branch
- **Transfer validation**: Product must exist in current transfer
- **Idempotency**: Uses idempotency keys for receive API calls

## Testing

### How to Test

**Prerequisites:**
1. Start API server: `cd api-server && npm run dev`
2. Start frontend: `cd admin-web && npm run dev`
3. Database must be seeded with test data: `npm run db:seed`

**Manual Testing Steps:**

1. **Create test transfer with barcoded products:**
   ```
   - Sign in as owner@acme.test / Password123! / acme
   - Create transfer from Main Warehouse to Secondary Warehouse
   - Add products: Acme Anvil (barcode: 5012345678900), Rocket Skates (barcode: 012345678905)
   - Ship transfer
   ```

2. **Test barcode scanning:**
   ```
   - Navigate to transfer detail page
   - Click "Scan to Receive" button
   - Grant camera permissions
   - Scan barcode using online barcode generator or phone screen
   - Verify product appears in scanned items list
   - Verify audio beep plays
   - Verify status indicator shows correct state
   - Scan same barcode again, verify qty increments
   - Click "Receive All Scanned Items"
   - Verify transfer status updates
   ```

3. **Test manual entry mode:**
   ```
   - Click "Manual Entry" button
   - Enter barcode: 5012345678900
   - Press Enter or click "Add"
   - Verify product appears in scanned items list
   ```

4. **Test error cases:**
   ```
   - Deny camera permissions → Verify error shown, manual mode available
   - Enter invalid barcode → Verify "Barcode not found" error
   - Scan product not in transfer → Verify "Not in this transfer" error
   - Scan fully received product → Verify "Already fully received" warning
   ```

5. **Test product barcode management:**
   ```
   - Navigate to Products page
   - Create new product
   - Set Barcode Type: EAN-13
   - Set Barcode: 5012345678900
   - Save product
   - Verify barcode fields persist
   - Edit product and update barcode
   - Verify barcode updates successfully
   ```

## Blockers & Issues

### Current Blockers
None

### Known Issues
1. **Camera permissions on mobile**:
   - iOS Safari requires HTTPS in production
   - Some Android browsers may require user gesture to start camera
   - **Workaround**: Manual entry mode always available

2. **Barcode format detection**:
   - html5-qrcode auto-detects format
   - No explicit validation of format match with `barcodeType`
   - **Impact**: Low (backend validates barcode uniqueness)

3. **Audio feedback on iOS**:
   - iOS may mute audio in low power mode
   - **Workaround**: Haptic feedback (vibration) still works
