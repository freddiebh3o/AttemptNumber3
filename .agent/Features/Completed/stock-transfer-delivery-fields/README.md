# Stock Transfer Delivery Fields

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Started:** October 25, 2025
**Completed:** October 25, 2025

## Overview
Enhanced stock transfers with delivery planning capabilities by adding expected delivery date and order notes fields. This enables users to plan operational logistics more effectively by tracking when transfers are expected to arrive and communicating additional context between branches during the transfer workflow.

## Key Features
- **Expected Delivery Date**: Track anticipated delivery dates for better operational planning
- **Order Notes**: Free-text field (2000 char max) for communicating special instructions or context
- **Date Range Filtering**: Filter transfers by expected delivery date range in list view
- **Full Integration**: Fields available throughout transfer lifecycle (create, view, filter)
- **Backward Compatible**: Fields are optional, existing transfers unaffected

## Problem Solved

**Before:**
- No way to track expected/requested delivery dates
- Limited ability to communicate order-specific context beyond request/review notes
- Difficult to plan receiving operations without delivery date visibility

**After:**
- Clear visibility into expected delivery dates for planning
- Order notes provide additional communication channel during workflow
- Filter transfers by delivery date to prioritize receiving operations
- Better coordination between source and destination branches

## Implementation

### Backend
- **Database Schema**: Added `expectedDeliveryDate` (DateTime, nullable) and `orderNotes` (String, nullable, max 2000 chars)
- **Migration**: `20251024235910_add_transfer_enahancements` - Added both fields with index on delivery date
- **Service Layer**: `createStockTransfer()` and `listStockTransfers()` updated to handle new fields
- **Filtering**: Date range filtering via `expectedDeliveryDateFrom` and `expectedDeliveryDateTo` query params
- **OpenAPI**: Updated schemas for type-safe frontend integration
- **Validation**: Zod validation for max length constraints

### Frontend
- **Create Modal**: DateInput and Textarea components with proper data-testid attributes
  - `data-testid="expected-delivery-date"` for date picker
  - `data-testid="order-notes"` for notes textarea
- **Detail Page**: Display delivery date in header and order notes in dedicated section
  - `data-testid="transfer-expected-delivery"` for delivery date display
  - `data-testid="transfer-order-notes"` for notes display
- **List View**: Date range filter inputs with chips for active filters
  - `data-testid="filter-delivery-date-range-from"` for date range start
  - `data-testid="filter-delivery-date-range-to"` for date range end
- **Navigation**: Create modal now navigates to detail page after successful creation

## Test Coverage
- **19 passing tests** (10 backend + 9 frontend E2E)
- **Backend Tests (Jest)**: `transferDeliveryFields.test.ts` with 10 comprehensive tests
  - Create transfer with delivery date and order notes
  - Create transfer with only delivery date
  - Create transfer with only order notes
  - Create transfer without optional fields (backward compatibility)
  - Filter by delivery date range (from, to, both)
  - Multi-tenant isolation
  - Validation (max length)
- **Frontend Tests (Playwright E2E)**: `transfer-delivery-fields.spec.ts` with 9 tests
  - Create with both fields and verify display
  - Create with only delivery date
  - Create with only order notes
  - Create without optional fields
  - Filter visibility and interaction
  - Clear delivery date filters via chips
  - Max length validation (2000 chars)
  - Accept max length input

## Documentation
- [PRD](./prd.md) - Complete implementation plan with both phases
- No new user documentation needed (straightforward UI enhancements)

## Architecture Decisions

**Why Optional Fields?**
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing transfers continue to work without migration
2. **Operational Flexibility**: Not all transfers require delivery date planning
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Teams can adopt features as needed

**Expected Delivery Date:**
- No validation for past dates on existing transfers (planning-only field)
- Indexed for fast filtering in list queries
- DateTime type allows time component if needed later

**Order Notes:**
- 2000 character limit balances flexibility with database efficiency
- Separate from requestNotes/reviewNotes for clear workflow separation
- Free-text field without structured validation for maximum flexibility

**Date Range Filtering:**
- Follows same pattern as requestedAt/shippedAt filters for UX consistency
- Both `from` and `to` params optional for flexible queries
- Uses active filter chips for easy removal

**Navigation After Creation:**
- Changed from refreshing list to navigating to detail page
- Provides immediate feedback on created transfer
- Matches user expectation to see what they just created

## Example Scenario

**Creating Transfer with Delivery Planning:**
```
User creates transfer from Warehouse to Store:
- Source: Warehouse
- Destination: Store
- Items: 100 units Coffee Beans
- Expected Delivery: October 30, 2025
- Order Notes: "Urgent delivery required for promotion event"

System:
1. Creates transfer with all fields
2. Navigates to transfer detail page
3. Shows delivery date in header: "Expected Delivery: 10/30/2025"
4. Shows order notes in dedicated alert section
```

**Filtering by Delivery Date:**
```
User opens Stock Transfers page:
1. Clicks "Filters" to expand filter bar
2. Selects delivery date range: Oct 25 - Oct 31
3. Clicks "Apply Filters"
4. Sees only transfers expected in that range
5. Active filter chip shows "Delivery ≥ 10/25/2025"
6. Clicks X on chip to clear filter
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ All new fields stored and retrieved correctly across transfer lifecycle
- ✅ Expected delivery date filters work accurately
- ✅ Order notes display correctly on detail page
- ✅ All existing transfer E2E tests still pass (no regressions)
- ✅ 10 new backend tests passing (237 total)
- ✅ 9 new E2E tests passing (133 total)

## Security
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation (tenantId filtering enforced)
- ✅ Permission-based access (`stock:read`, `stock:write` required)
- ✅ Input validation (max length constraints)
- ✅ No XSS vulnerabilities (text properly escaped in UI)

## Known Limitations
- Expected delivery date is planning-only (no automatic notifications)
- No validation for delivery date conflicts (multiple transfers same day)
- Order notes cannot be updated after creation (would require edit endpoint)

## Future Enhancements
- Delivery date notifications/alerts when date approaches
- Automatic delivery scheduling/routing
- Capacity planning based on expected delivery dates
- Edit transfer endpoint to update delivery fields after creation
- Calendar view of expected deliveries by branch

## Notes
This feature provides essential delivery planning capabilities while maintaining simplicity and backward compatibility. The implementation follows established patterns (DateInput components, filter chips, data-testid attributes) for consistency with the rest of the application. All tests pass with proper date picker interaction patterns, ensuring reliable E2E coverage.
