# Stock Transfers V2 - Phase 3: Barcode-Based Bulk Receive

**Status:** ‚è≥ In Progress
**Start Date:** 2025-10-14
**Completion Date:** TBD

## Overview

Phase 3 adds barcode scanning capabilities to enable warehouse staff to quickly receive transferred items by scanning product barcodes with their smartphone camera. This eliminates manual quantity entry and speeds up the receiving process significantly.

**Time Savings:**
- Traditional: 5 minutes to receive 10-item transfer (find product, enter quantity, repeat)
- Barcode: 30 seconds to receive 10-item transfer (scan, scan, scan, done)

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Database Schema ‚úÖ
- [x] database-expert: Add barcode fields to Product model

### Phase 2: Backend API ‚úÖ
- [x] backend-api-expert: Create barcode lookup endpoint
- [x] backend-api-expert: Update product schemas to include barcode fields (Note: receive endpoint already supports bulk receiving from Phase 1)

### Phase 3: Frontend UI ‚úÖ
- [x] frontend-expert: Implement barcode scanner modal with camera integration
- [x] frontend-expert: Update transfer detail page with "Scan to Receive" button
- [x] frontend-expert: Add barcode field to product management

### Phase 4: Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] test-engineer: Backend unit tests for barcode lookup (45 tests)
- [x] test-engineer: E2E tests for barcode scanning workflow (15 tests)

### Phase 5: Integration ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [x] integration-orchestrator: Type generation, deployment checklist (BLOCKED - see below)

### integration-orchestrator
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked (Backend Issue Identified - 2025-10-14)
- Output: [integration-orchestrator.md](./integration-orchestrator.md)
- Blocker: Backend product service missing barcode field handling (8/23 tests failing)

## Key Features

1. **Barcode Support:**
   - Products have optional barcode field (unique per tenant)
   - Supports EAN-13, UPC-A, Code128, QR codes
   - Admin can add/edit barcodes via product page

2. **Camera Integration:**
   - Web-based scanning using HTML5 MediaDevices API
   - Works on iPhone Safari (iOS 11+) and Android Chrome
   - No native app required

3. **Receiving Workflow:**
   - User opens "Scan to Receive" modal on transfer detail page
   - Camera viewfinder with scanning overlay
   - Real-time scanned items list with counts
   - Validation against expected items
   - Bulk submit all scanned items

4. **UX Enhancements:**
   - Audio/haptic feedback on successful scan
   - Visual confirmation (green flash)
   - Error handling (item not in transfer, already received)
   - Manual entry fallback if camera unavailable

## Integration Status

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED**

**Blocker:** Backend product service missing barcode field handling
- **Tests:** 15/23 backend tests passing (65%)
- **Root Cause:** `productService.ts` not handling barcode fields in create/update
- **Impact:** Frontend barcode management UI will not work
- **Resolution:** backend-api-expert needs to fix product service
- **ETA:** Fix required before deployment

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Database migration applied
- ‚úÖ Barcode lookup API (9/9 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ Frontend UI components complete
- ‚úÖ OpenAPI types synchronized
- ‚úÖ Builds successful

**What's Blocked:**
- ‚ùå Product CRUD with barcodes (8 tests failing)
- ‚è≥ Frontend E2E tests (not run - blocked by backend)
- ‚è≥ Deployment (blocked until 23/23 tests pass)

**Next Steps:**
1. backend-api-expert fixes product service
2. Re-run tests (expect 23/23 passing)
3. Run frontend E2E tests (expect 15/15 passing)
4. Deploy to staging
5. Manual mobile testing (iOS + Android)
6. Production deployment
