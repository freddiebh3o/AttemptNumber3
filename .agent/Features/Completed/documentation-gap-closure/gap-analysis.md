---

## Important Gaps (Priority 2)

### 4. Archival Pattern - Documented as "None Currently"

**Finding:** [architecture.md](../../System/architecture.md) says "Soft deletes: None currently" but archival is implemented across 6+ entities

**Impact:** Medium - Pattern is widely used but not formally documented

**Entities Using Archival:**
1. **Product** - `isArchived`, `archivedAt`, `archivedByUserId`
2. **UserTenantMembership** - Soft delete via deletion
3. **Branch** - `isActive` field (deactivation)
4. **StockTransferTemplate** - Full archival fields
5. **TransferApprovalRule** - Full archival fields
6. **Role** - Soft delete support (system roles protected)

**Archival Pattern:**
```typescript
// Standard archival fields
isArchived: Boolean (default false)
archivedAt: DateTime (nullable)
archivedByUserId: String (nullable, FK → User)

// Relationship
archivedByUser: User? (nullable)
```

**UI Pattern:**
- Archive filter dropdown (active-only, archived-only, all)
- Archived badge in list views
- Inactive badge for deactivated items
- Archive/restore confirmation modals
- Preserve original `isActive` state on restore

**Recommendation:** Document unified archival pattern in architecture.md (Phase 4)

---

### 5. RBAC Permissions - Outdated Count

**Finding:** [rbac-system.md](../../System/rbac-system.md) says "11 permissions" but catalog.ts defines 14

**Impact:** Medium - Permission catalog is primary reference for developers

**Actual Permissions (from `api-server/src/rbac/catalog.ts`):**
1. ✅ `products:read`
2. ✅ `products:write`
3. ✅ `users:manage`
4. ✅ `roles:manage`
5. ✅ `tenant:manage`
6. ✅ `theme:manage`
7. ✅ `uploads:write`
8. ✅ `branches:manage`
9. ✅ `stock:read`
10. ✅ `stock:write`
11. ✅ `stock:allocate`
12. ❌ **Missing:** `stock:transfer` (transfer creation)
13. ❌ **Missing:** `reports:view` (analytics dashboard)
14. ❌ **Missing:** One more permission (verify in catalog.ts)

**Documented Permissions:** Only 11 shown in permission catalog table

**Recommendation:** Complete Phase 4 of PRD (update RBAC documentation)

---

### 6. Feature Flags System - Missing from System Docs

**Finding:** Feature flags are implemented and have SOP but missing from architecture.md and database-schema.md

**Impact:** Medium - System-level feature control mechanism not explained

**Implemented:**
- ✅ `featureFlags` JSON column on Tenant table
- ✅ Backend propagation (included in auth response)
- ✅ Frontend hook: `useFeatureFlag(key)`
- ✅ Current flags: `barcodeScanningEnabled`, `barcodeScanningMode`

**SOP Exists:** [.agent/SOP/feature_flags_usage.md](../../SOP/feature_flags_usage.md) - Implementation guide

**Missing from System Docs:**
- Feature flag architecture not in architecture.md
- `featureFlags` field not in database-schema.md (Tenant table)
- Feature control strategy not explained
- When to use flags vs permissions not documented

**Recommendation:** Complete Phase 4 of PRD (architecture documentation)

---

### 7. Transfer Analytics - Reporting Infrastructure Not Explained

**Finding:** Analytics tables exist but reporting strategy not documented

**Impact:** Medium - Analytics are production features but architecture unclear

**Implemented:**
- ✅ `TransferMetrics` - Daily aggregated metrics
- ✅ `TransferRouteMetrics` - Branch dependency analysis
- ✅ Analytics dashboard UI
- ✅ Metrics aggregation (likely nightly batch job)

**Missing Documentation:**
- Metrics aggregation strategy (when/how data is computed)
- Dashboard architecture
- Query optimization patterns
- Data retention policy

**Recommendation:** Complete Phase 2 of PRD (stock transfer system documentation)

---
