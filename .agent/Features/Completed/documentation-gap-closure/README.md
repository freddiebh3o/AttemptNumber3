# Documentation Gap Closure

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days
**Created:** 2025-10-19

## Overview

Systematic closure of critical documentation gaps in the .agent documentation system. Analysis revealed 34% of database tables are undocumented, and major features like AI chatbot, multi-level approval workflows, and analytics infrastructure are missing from System docs.

## Key Deliverables

- Complete database schema documentation (41/41 tables, currently 27/41)
- Comprehensive stock transfer system documentation (approval workflows, templates, analytics)
- AI chatbot assistant system documentation (RAG, tools, embeddings)
- Archival pattern documentation across all entities
- Updated RBAC permission catalog (14 permissions correctly documented)
- Updated tech stack with AI integrations (OpenAI, Vercel AI SDK)

## Documentation

- [PRD](./prd.md) - Complete implementation plan with 4 phases
- [Gap Analysis](./gap-analysis.md) - Detailed findings from repository analysis

## Major Documentation Gaps Identified

### Critical (Priority 1)
1. **14 Database Tables Missing** (34% of schema)
   - Stock transfer tables (8 tables)
   - AI chatbot tables (4 tables)
   - Analytics tables (2 tables)

2. **AI Chatbot System** - Completely undocumented
   - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system
   - 8+ AI tool categories
   - Vector embeddings (1536 dimensions)
   - OpenAI integration

3. **Multi-Level Approval Workflow** - Complex business logic not explained
   - Approval rules and conditions
   - Sequential/Parallel/Hybrid approval modes
   - Approval level hierarchy

### Important (Priority 2)
4. **Archival Pattern** - Documented as "None currently" but implemented everywhere
   - Product, User, Branch, Template, Approval rule archival
   - Soft delete strategy with restore capability

5. **RBAC Permissions** - Outdated count (says 11, actually 14)
   - Missing `reports:view` permission
   - Stock transfer permissions not fully documented

6. **Feature Flags System** - Has SOP but missing from System docs
   - Tenant-level JSON column approach
   - Frontend hooks and backend propagation

7. **Transfer Analytics** - Reporting infrastructure not explained
   - Daily metrics aggregation
   - Route analysis and bottleneck detection

### Nice to Have (Priority 3)
8. **Barcode Scanning** - Partially documented
9. **Transfer Templates** - Mentioned but not comprehensive
10. **Partial Shipments** - Tracking mechanism undocumented

## Database Changes

**No database changes** - This is documentation-only work

## API Changes

**No API changes** - This is documentation-only work

## Frontend Changes

**No frontend changes** - This is documentation-only work

## Permissions

**No new permissions** - Documentation will correct existing permission catalog

## Testing

**No new tests needed** - Documentation accuracy verified against existing codebase

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Completion (1 day)
- Document all 14 missing tables in database-schema.md
- Update ERD diagram
- Update table statistics

### Phase 2: Stock Transfer System Documentation (1 day)
- Create Domain/transfers.md OR expand stock-management.md
- Document approval workflows, templates, analytics
- Document reversal logic

### Phase 3: AI Chatbot System Documentation (1 day)
- Update architecture.md with AI integration
- Create Domain/ai-chatbot.md
- Document RAG, tools, analytics

### Phase 4: Architecture & Pattern Documentation (1 day)
- Document archival pattern
- Document feature flags system
- Update tech stack (OpenAI, Vercel AI SDK)
- Correct RBAC permission count

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 100% database tables documented (41/41, currently 66%)
- [ ] All major features covered in System docs
- [ ] Tech stack completely accurate
- [ ] RBAC permission catalog accurate (14 permissions)
- [ ] Zero broken cross-references
- [ ] All "Last Updated" timestamps current

## Notes

**Why This Matters:**
- Documentation is the primary reference for new developers
- AI assistant relies on accurate documentation for context
- Gap between docs and code creates confusion
- 34% missing tables is a significant knowledge gap

**Approach:**
- Systematic phase-based documentation updates
- Reference actual code files (schema.prisma, catalog.ts, etc.)
- Maintain existing formatting and style conventions
- Cross-reference liberally between documents

**Validation Strategy:**
- Line-by-line comparison with schema.prisma (all 41 tables)
- Line-by-line comparison with rbac/catalog.ts (all 14 permissions)
- Peer review by another developer
- Check all file reference links
