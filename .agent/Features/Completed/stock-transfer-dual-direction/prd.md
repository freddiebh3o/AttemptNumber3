# Stock Transfer Dual-Direction Initiation - Implementation Plan

**Status:** ✅ Complete (Backend + Frontend + E2E Tests)
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days
**Created:** 2025-10-25
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25

## Overview

This feature enables dual-direction transfer workflows, allowing users to either push stock to other branches OR request stock from other branches. This provides operational flexibility for different business scenarios - warehouses can send stock proactively, or retail locations can request stock when needed.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Create PUSH transfers (send stock to another branch - existing behavior)
- Create PULL transfers (request stock from another branch - new behavior)
- Filter transfers by initiation type and initiating branch
- Distinct access control rules based on initiation direction

**Related Documentation:**
- [Stock Transfer System](.agent/System/stock-transfers.md) - Current implementation
- [Database Schema](.agent/System/database-schema.md) - Prisma models reference
- [Testing Overview](.agent/SOP/testing_overview.md) - Testing procedures

## Phase 1: Database Schema & Service Layer

**Goal:** Add initiation type and initiating branch tracking, implement dual-direction access control logic

**Relevant Files:**
- [api-server/prisma/schema.prisma](../../../api-server/prisma/schema.prisma) - Add `TransferInitiationType` enum
- [api-server/src/services/stockTransfers/stockTransferService.ts](../../../api-server/src/services/stockTransfers/stockTransferService.ts)
- [api-server/src/services/stockTransfers/transferHelpers.ts](../../../api-server/src/services/stockTransfers/transferHelpers.ts)
- [api-server/src/openapi/paths/stockTransfers.ts](../../../api-server/src/openapi/paths/stockTransfers.ts)

### Backend Implementation

- [x] Database schema changes (migration: `20251025202810_add_transfer_initiation_type`)
  - Add `TransferInitiationType` enum: `PUSH`, `PULL`
  - Add `initiationType` field to StockTransfer (default: `PUSH`)
  - Add `initiatedByBranchId` field (references Branch, nullable)
  - Add indexes on `initiationType` and `initiatedByBranchId` for filtering
- [x] Prisma client regeneration (`npm run prisma:generate`)
- [x] Update `createStockTransfer()` service function
  - Accept `initiationType` parameter (optional, defaults to PUSH)
  - Set `initiatedByBranchId` based on initiation type
  - PUSH: source branch initiates (user must be in source)
  - PULL: destination branch initiates (user must be in destination)
- [x] Update access control logic in `transferHelpers.ts`
  - `assertTransferAccess()`: allow access if user in initiating branch
  - Create validation: PUSH requires source branch membership, PULL requires destination membership
  - Review validation: PUSH requires destination membership, PULL requires source membership
- [x] Update `listStockTransfers()` filters
  - Add `initiationType` filter (PUSH/PULL)
  - Add `initiatedByMe` boolean filter (filters by user's branch memberships)
- [x] Update OpenAPI schemas for new fields and filters
  - `StockTransferSchema`: Added `initiationType` and `initiatedByBranchId`
  - `CreateTransferBodySchema`: Added optional `initiationType` parameter
  - List query parameters: Added `initiationType` and `initiatedByMe` filters
- [x] Update router to parse new query parameters and body fields
- [x] Backend tests written ([transferDualDirection.test.ts](../../../api-server/__tests__/features/stockTransfers/transferDualDirection.test.ts))
  - Test PUSH workflow (5 tests: create, default, reject invalid, destination reviews, source cannot review)
  - Test PULL workflow (4 tests: create, reject invalid, source reviews, destination cannot review)
  - Test access control for both types (covered in above tests)
  - Test filtering by initiation type (2 tests: PUSH filter, PULL filter)
  - Test filtering by initiatedByMe (1 test)
  - Test multi-tenant isolation (1 test)
  - Test audit trail (2 tests: PUSH audit, PULL audit)
  - **Total: 15 passing tests**

- [x] Update existing transfer tests to match new PUSH workflow (50+ tests updated and passing)

### Frontend Implementation (Deferred to Phase 2)

- [x] OpenAPI types regenerated (`npm run openapi:gen`)
- [x] Update API client with new fields and filters ([stockTransfers.ts](../../../admin-web/src/api/stockTransfers.ts))
  - Added `initiationType` and `initiatedByMe` parameters to `listStockTransfersApiRequest`
- [x] E2E tests written following [GUIDELINES.md](../../../admin-web/e2e/GUIDELINES.md)
  - Test creating PUSH transfer (current behavior) ✅
  - Test creating PULL transfer (request from another branch) ✅
  - Test access control for both types ✅
  - Test filtering by "Initiated by me" vs "Requested from me" ✅
  - **Total: 7 passing E2E tests** ([transfer-dual-direction.spec.ts](../../../admin-web/e2e/features/transfers/transfer-dual-direction.spec.ts))

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Initiation Type Default**: Default to `PUSH` (existing behavior) to maintain backward compatibility with current workflows
- **Access Control**: PUSH requires source membership for create, destination for approve; PULL reverses this logic
- **Branch Context**: Initiating branch auto-fills based on user's current branch context (not user-selectable)
- **Immutability**: Initiation type cannot be changed after transfer creation (workflow consistency)

**Known Limitations:**
- Initiation type cannot be changed after transfer creation
- User must have branch membership to initiate (no cross-branch initiation without membership)
- No bulk transfer creation for mixed PUSH/PULL types

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Automatic PULL requests based on low stock triggers
- Recurring transfer schedules (weekly restocking)
- Multi-branch PULL requests (request from multiple sources simultaneously)
- Transfer templates for common PUSH/PULL patterns
