# Features Permission Restructuring - COMPLETED

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** ✅ All Changes Implemented and Tested

---

## Summary

Successfully restructured feature settings permissions from `theme:manage` to dedicated `features:read` and `features:manage` permissions. This provides better semantic clarity and implements a proper read-only access model for non-owner users.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend Permission System

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ [api-server/src/rbac/catalog.ts](../../../api-server/src/rbac/catalog.ts)
- ✅ [api-server/src/utils/permissions.ts](../../../api-server/src/utils/permissions.ts)
- ✅ [api-server/src/routes/tenantThemeRouter.ts](../../../api-server/src/routes/tenantThemeRouter.ts)

**New Permissions:**
- `features:read` - View feature settings (assigned to ALL system roles)
- `features:manage` - Modify feature settings (assigned to OWNER only)

**Role Permission Updates:**
| Role | features:read | features:manage |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| OWNER | ✅ | ✅ |
| ADMIN | ✅ | ❌ |
| EDITOR | ✅ | ❌ |
| VIEWER | ✅ | ❌ |

### 2. API Route Updates

**GET /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/feature-flags**
- Changed from: `requirePermission('theme:manage')`
- Changed to: `requirePermission('features:read')`
- Effect: All roles can now view feature settings

**PUT /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/feature-flags**
- Changed from: `requirePermission('theme:manage')`
- Changed to: `requirePermission('features:manage')`
- Effect: Only OWNER can modify feature settings

### 3. Frontend UI Updates

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ [admin-web/src/main.tsx](../../../admin-web/src/main.tsx)
- ✅ [admin-web/src/pages/FeatureSettingsPage.tsx](../../../admin-web/src/pages/FeatureSettingsPage.tsx)

**Route Protection:**
- Changed settings/features route to require `features:read` instead of `theme:manage`
- All authenticated users can now access the page

**UI Enhancements:**
- Added read-only mode detection using `usePermissions()` hook
- Disabled all input fields when user lacks `features:manage` permission
- Hide Save button for non-owner users
- Display informational alert: *"You have permission to view feature settings, but only the account owner can modify them."*
- Added `data-testid="alert-read-only"` for E2E testing

### 4. Test Updates

**Backend Tests:**
- ✅ [api-server/__tests__/permissions/theme.permissions.test.ts](../../../api-server/__tests__/permissions/theme.permissions.test.ts)
- Updated GET feature-flags tests: All roles now pass (previously EDITOR/VIEWER failed)
- Updated PUT feature-flags tests: Only OWNER passes (previously ADMIN also passed)
- All tests passing ✅

**Frontend E2E Tests:**
- ✅ [admin-web/e2e/features/settings/feature-settings.spec.ts](../../../admin-web/e2e/features/settings/feature-settings.spec.ts)
- Added read-only mode tests for ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER roles
- Verify disabled inputs and hidden Save button
- Verify read-only alert visibility
- Verify all roles can navigate to Features page
- All tests passing ✅

### 5. Documentation Updates

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ [docs/settings/feature-settings.md](../../../docs/settings/feature-settings.md)

**Updates:**
- Updated access level section to clarify view vs modify permissions
- Added "Understanding Read-Only Mode" section
- Updated FAQ: "Who can view and change feature settings?"
- Clarified permission requirements throughout
- Updated last modified date to 2025-10-27

## Test Commands

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd api-server
node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --config jest.config.js __tests__/permissions/theme.permissions.test.ts
```

### Frontend E2E Tests
```bash
cd admin-web
npm run test:accept features/settings/feature-settings.spec.ts
```

### Results
- ✅ Backend: All permission tests passing
- ✅ Frontend: All E2E tests passing

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Tenants

**Database:**
- RBAC seed was run to sync new permissions to database
- All existing roles automatically received appropriate permissions

**Behavioral Changes:**
- ADMIN users can no longer modify feature settings (lost `features:manage`)
- ADMIN users can still VIEW feature settings (have `features:read`)
- EDITOR/VIEWER users can now VIEW feature settings (gained `features:read`)
- Only OWNER retains full control (has both `features:read` and `features:manage`)

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All existing API endpoints continue to work
- No data migrations required
- Feature flag values remain unchanged
- Chat history and settings preserved

---

## Key Decisions

1. **Read-Only UI vs Permission Denied**
   - Chose to show read-only UI instead of blocking access
   - Better UX: Users can see current settings
   - Transparency: All users know which features are enabled

2. **Owner-Only Write Access**
   - Feature settings affect billing and tenant-wide capabilities
   - ADMIN role no longer has write access
   - Maintains tighter control over organizational costs

3. **Backend Enforcement**
   - Backend API enforces write permission as final security layer
   - Frontend disables inputs but backend validates
   - Defense in depth strategy

---

## Success Criteria

✅ All success criteria met:
- [x] `features:read` and `features:manage` permissions exist in catalog
- [x] ONLY OWNER role has `features:manage` permission
- [x] All system roles have `features:read` permission
- [x] Backend tests pass with new permission expectations
- [x] Frontend E2E tests pass with read-only UI for non-owners
- [x] No breaking changes to existing theme:manage functionality
- [x] User documentation updated and accurate

---

## Future Enhancements

**Out of Scope for This PR:**
- Permission audit log showing who changed feature settings
- Separate permissions for individual features (e.g., `chat:manage`, `barcode:manage`)
- Role-based feature visibility (hide certain features from certain roles)
- API key encryption at rest
