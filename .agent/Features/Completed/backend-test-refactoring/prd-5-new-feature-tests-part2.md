## Testing Strategy

### Service Tests

**Pattern:**
- Direct service function calls (no HTTP)
- Focus on business logic and domain rules
- Test complex workflows (approval evaluation)
- Verify data transformations
- Test edge cases and error handling

### Route Tests

**Pattern:**
- Express router with middleware
- Supertest for HTTP requests
- Validate request/response formats
- Test authentication and basic authorization
- Minimal permission testing (full coverage in permissions/)

### Integration Points

**Special considerations:**
- Uploads: Mock Supabase client for file operations
- Approvals: Complex rule evaluation logic requires thorough testing
- Analytics: Date range queries and aggregations
- Multi-tenant isolation critical for all features

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Mock Supabase for upload tests**
   - **Rationale:** Avoid external dependencies in unit tests
   - **Alternative:** Use real Supabase (rejected: slow, flaky, requires credentials)

2. **Comprehensive approval evaluation testing**
   - **Rationale:** Complex business logic with many edge cases
   - **Alternative:** Minimal coverage (rejected: approval bugs are high-risk)

3. **Route tests for transfers even though service tests exist**
   - **Rationale:** HTTP layer validation is distinct from service logic
   - **Alternative:** Skip route tests (rejected: incomplete coverage)

4. **Separate approval rules and evaluation tests**
   - **Rationale:** CRUD logic separate from evaluation algorithm
   - **Alternative:** Combined file (rejected: too large, mixed concerns)

5. **Analytics route tests without service tests**
   - **Rationale:** Service tests exist, only need HTTP layer coverage
   - **Alternative:** Add service tests too (rejected: already covered)

**Known Limitations:**
- Upload tests don't cover actual file storage (mocked)
- Approval evaluation tests may be slow (complex setup)
- Analytics tests may need significant seed data
- Theme tests limited to color/preset validation (no visual testing)

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Integration tests with real Supabase
- Visual regression testing for theme changes
- Load testing for analytics queries
- Approval workflow UI testing (E2E)
