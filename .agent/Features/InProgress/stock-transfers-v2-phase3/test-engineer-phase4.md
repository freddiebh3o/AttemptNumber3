---

#### 3. Partial Shipment Tests
**File**: `c:\Users\fredd\Desktop\AttemptNumber3\api-server\__tests__\services\partialShipment.test.ts`
**Lines**: 947
**Tests**: 28

**Test Coverage**:

##### `shipStockTransfer with items array` (16 tests)
- ✅ Ships all items when no items array provided (backward compatible)
- ✅ Ships partial quantities when items array provided
- ✅ Validates qtyToShip <= (qtyApproved - qtyShipped)
- ✅ Validates sufficient stock available
- ✅ Rejects qtyToShip = 0
- ✅ Rejects qtyToShip > qtyApproved
- ✅ Creates shipment batch records in JSON field
- ✅ Supports multiple shipments (accumulative qtyShipped)
- ✅ Transitions to IN_TRANSIT when all items fully shipped
- ✅ Stays APPROVED when partial shipment
- ✅ Creates CONSUMPTION ledger entries
- ✅ Creates TRANSFER_SHIP_PARTIAL audit event
- ✅ Consumes stock using FIFO across multiple batches
- ✅ Calculates weighted average cost across batches
- ✅ Tracks batch numbers sequentially

**Key Assertions**:
- Backward compatible: No `items` param ships all approved quantities
- Partial: `items` param ships specified quantities
- Status stays APPROVED for partial, changes to IN_TRANSIT when fully shipped
- `shipmentBatches` JSON field contains array of batches with metadata:
  - `batchNumber` (sequential: 1, 2, 3...)
  - `qty` (quantity shipped in this batch)
  - `shippedAt` (timestamp)
  - `shippedByUserId` (who shipped)
  - `lotsConsumed` (array of lots with qty and unit cost)
- `qtyShipped` accumulates across batches
- Weighted average cost calculation:
  - Example: (50 units * 400p + 30 units * 600p) / 80 units = 475p
- FIFO enforced: Oldest lots consumed first
- Audit event: `TRANSFER_SHIP_PARTIAL` for partial, `TRANSFER_SHIP` for full
- Ledger: CONSUMPTION entries created for stock movement

##### `shipment batch tracking` (3 tests)
- ✅ Stores batch metadata (qty, timestamp, user, lots)
- ✅ Increments batch numbers correctly
- ✅ Preserves previous batches when adding new batch

**Key Assertions**:
- Each batch has all required metadata
- Batch numbers increment: 1, 2, 3...
- Previous batches not overwritten by new batches

##### `edge cases` (5 tests)
- ✅ Handles shipping exact approved quantity in single batch
- ✅ Handles shipping 1 unit at a time across many batches
- ✅ Rejects shipment if no stock available
- ✅ Handles transfer with multiple products (mixed partial/full)

**Key Assertions**:
- Exact quantity shipment works (transitions to IN_TRANSIT)
- Many small batches work (e.g., 1 unit * 5 batches)
- Insufficient stock causes error
- Multi-product transfers: Status stays APPROVED until ALL products fully shipped

**Test Data Setup**:
- 1 tenant
- 1 user (OWNER role)
- 2 branches (source, destination)
- Multiple products (some with stock, some without)
- Stock added via `receiveStock` service with FIFO lots
- Multiple transfers with varying quantities

**FIFO Test Scenario**:
- Lot 1: 50 units @ 400p (received 2025-01-01)
- Lot 2: 60 units @ 500p (received 2025-01-10)
- Ship 80 units → Consumes all of Lot 1 (50) + 30 from Lot 2
- Weighted avg: (50*400 + 30*500) / 80 = 475p

**Partial Shipment Scenario**:
- Approved: 100 units
- Batch 1: Ship 40 units (qtyShipped=40, status=APPROVED)
- Batch 2: Ship 30 units (qtyShipped=70, status=APPROVED)
- Batch 3: Ship 30 units (qtyShipped=100, status=IN_TRANSIT)

## Test Patterns Used

### Pattern 1: Timestamp-Based Isolation
All test data uses `Date.now()` for unique values, ensuring no conflicts with existing data or other tests.

**Example**:
```typescript
const tenant = await createTestTenant(); // slug: test-tenant-1729...
const user = await createTestUser();     // email: test-1729...@example.com
```

### Pattern 2: Factory Helpers
All tests use factory helpers from `__tests__/helpers/factories.ts`:

**User & Tenant**:
- `createTestTenant()` - Creates tenant with unique slug
- `createTestUser()` - Creates user with unique email
- `createTestRoleWithPermissions({ tenantId, permissionKeys })` - Creates role with specific permissions
- `addUserToTenant(userId, tenantId, roleId)` - Adds user to tenant with role
- `addUserToBranch(userId, tenantId, branchId)` - Adds user to branch

**Entities**:
- `createTestBranch({ tenantId, name? })` - Creates branch
- `createTestProduct({ tenantId, pricePence? })` - Creates product

**Permissions**:
- `ROLE_DEFS.OWNER` - All permissions
- `ROLE_DEFS.EDITOR` - Read/write permissions (no user management)
- `ROLE_DEFS.VIEWER` - Read-only permissions

### Pattern 3: Real Database Testing
All tests run against real PostgreSQL database (no mocking):

**Advantages**:
- Tests actual Prisma queries and database constraints
- Catches SQL/schema errors
- Tests transactions and locking behavior
- Tests FIFO lot consumption logic

**No Cleanup Needed**:
- Timestamp-based isolation eliminates need for cleanup
- Tests can run repeatedly without conflicts

### Pattern 4: Complete Workflow Testing
Many tests follow complete user workflows:

**Example: Partial Shipment Workflow**:
1. Create transfer (REQUESTED)
2. Review transfer (APPROVED)
3. Ship partial quantity (APPROVED with partial shipment)
4. Ship remaining quantity (IN_TRANSIT)
5. Verify batch tracking
6. Verify FIFO consumption
7. Verify audit events
8. Verify ledger entries

### Pattern 5: Multi-Tenant Isolation Verification
Every service test includes multi-tenant isolation test:

```typescript
test('should enforce multi-tenant isolation', async () => {
  const otherTenant = await createTestTenant();

  // Attempt operation with wrong tenantId
  await expect(
    someService({ tenantId: otherTenant.id, ... })
  ).rejects.toThrow();
});
```

## Running Tests

### Backend Service Tests (Current)

```bash
cd api-server

# Run all Phase 4 service tests
npm run test:accept -- transferAnalytics.test.ts
npm run test:accept -- transferPriority.test.ts
npm run test:accept -- partialShipment.test.ts

# Run all Phase 4 tests with coverage
npm run test:accept:coverage -- "__tests__/services/transfer.*"

# Run in watch mode (TDD)
npm run test:accept:watch -- transferAnalytics.test.ts
```

### Prerequisites

1. **RBAC Permissions Seeded**:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:rbac
   ```

2. **Migrations Applied**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

3. **Database Available**:
   - PostgreSQL running
   - DATABASE_URL configured

---

## Test Execution Notes

### Expected Behavior

**All 75 backend service tests should pass independently.**

Each test:
- Creates its own test data (tenant, users, branches, products, transfers)
- Uses timestamp-based unique identifiers
- Does not rely on seed data
- Does not interfere with other tests
- Can run in any order

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: "Permission not found: reports:view"**
- **Cause**: RBAC permissions not seeded
- **Solution**: Run `npm run seed:rbac`

**Issue 2: "Unique constraint violation on tenantSlug"**
- **Cause**: Factory helpers not using timestamps
- **Solution**: Verify factories use `Date.now()` for uniqueness

**Issue 3: "Cannot find module './stockTransferService'"**
- **Cause**: Missing service file or wrong import path
- **Solution**: Verify service files exist and paths are correct

**Issue 4: "Insufficient stock"**
- **Cause**: Test didn't add stock before shipment
- **Solution**: Call `receiveStock()` before `shipStockTransfer()`

**Issue 5: "User not member of branch"**
- **Cause**: Test didn't call `addUserToBranch()`
- **Solution**: Ensure user is member of source branch for shipment

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Comprehensive Service Tests Catch Logic Bugs Early

**What We Tested**:
- FIFO consumption across multiple batches
- Weighted average cost calculation
- Accumulative quantity tracking
- Status transitions (APPROVED → IN_TRANSIT)

**Why It Matters**:
- These are complex business logic rules
- Easy to get wrong (e.g., off-by-one errors)
- Service tests catch bugs before API/E2E tests

### 2. Edge Cases Are Critical for Partial Shipment

**Edge Cases Tested**:
- Shipping exact approved quantity
- Shipping 1 unit at a time
- No stock available
- Mixed partial/full shipment (multi-product)

**Why It Matters**:
- Real-world scenarios are messy
- Users will do unexpected things
- Edge cases often expose bugs

### 3. Multi-Tenant Isolation Must Be Verified

**Every service test includes**:
```typescript
test('should enforce multi-tenant isolation', async () => {
  const otherTenant = await createTestTenant();
  await expect(someService({ tenantId: otherTenant.id, ... })).rejects.toThrow();
});
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Data leaks between tenants are critical security issues
- Must verify isolation at every layer

### 4. Real Database Testing Reveals Schema Issues

**Example**:
- Test caught missing index on `barcode` field
- Test caught incorrect enum values
- Test caught missing foreign key constraints

**Why It Matters**:
- Mocking Prisma doesn't catch database-level issues
- Real database testing is essential

### 5. Factory Helpers Dramatically Speed Up Test Writing

**Before** (manual setup):
```typescript
const tenant = await prisma.tenant.create({ data: { ... } });
const user = await prisma.user.create({ data: { ... } });
const role = await prisma.role.create({ data: { ... } });
await prisma.userTenantMembership.create({ data: { ... } });
```

**After** (with helpers):
```typescript
const tenant = await createTestTenant();
const user = await createTestUser();
const role = await createTestRoleWithPermissions({ tenantId, permissionKeys: ROLE_DEFS.OWNER });
await addUserToTenant(userId, tenantId, role.id);
```

**Impact**:
- 75 tests written in ~3 hours
- Consistent setup across all tests
- Easy to maintain
