---

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Transfer Analytics (7 endpoints)

All endpoints under `/api/stock-transfers/analytics`:

| Endpoint | Method | Permission | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| `/overview` | GET | `reports:view` | Overview metrics (4 cards) |
| `/volume-chart` | GET | `reports:view` | Time series data for line chart |
| `/branch-dependencies` | GET | `reports:view` | Transfer volume between branches |
| `/top-routes` | GET | `reports:view` | Top routes with avg completion time |
| `/status-distribution` | GET | `reports:view` | Status counts for pie chart |
| `/bottlenecks` | GET | `reports:view` | Avg time in each stage |
| `/product-frequency` | GET | `reports:view` | Most transferred products |

**Query Parameters** (all endpoints):
- `startDate` (optional): YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to 30 days ago
- `endDate` (optional): YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today
- `branchId` (optional): Filter by branch (overview only)
- `limit` (optional): Limit results (routes and products, default: 10)

---

### Priority Management (1 new + 1 modified)

| Endpoint | Method | Permission | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| `/stock-transfers` | POST | `stock:write` | Create transfer (now accepts `priority` field) |
| `/stock-transfers/:id/priority` | PATCH | `stock:write` | Update transfer priority |

**Priority Values**: URGENT, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW

**Validation**:
- Only REQUESTED or APPROVED transfers can change priority
- User must be member of source or destination branch
- Creates `TRANSFER_PRIORITY_CHANGE` audit event

---

### Partial Shipment (1 modified)

| Endpoint | Method | Permission | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| `/stock-transfers/:id/ship` | POST | `stock:write` | Ship transfer (now supports partial) |

**Request Body** (backward compatible):
```json
{
  "items": [ // OPTIONAL: If omitted, ships all approved quantities
    {
      "itemId": "uuid",
      "qtyToShip": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

**Behavior**:
- Without `items`: Ships all approved quantities (original behavior)
- With `items`: Ships only specified quantities (partial shipment)
- Status stays APPROVED for partial, changes to IN_TRANSIT when fully shipped
- Each shipment creates a batch in `shipmentBatches` JSON field
- Accumulative `qtyShipped` tracking
- Weighted average cost calculation across batches

---

## Files Created

## Implementation Details

### Analytics Calculations

**Overview Metrics**:
- Total transfers: `count()` in date range
- Active transfers: `count()` where status in [REQUESTED, APPROVED, IN_TRANSIT, PARTIALLY_RECEIVED]
- Avg approval time: avg(reviewedAt - requestedAt) in seconds
- Avg ship time: avg(shippedAt - reviewedAt) in seconds
- Avg receive time: avg(completedAt - shippedAt) in seconds

**Volume Chart**:
- Groups transfers by date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Counts created (requestedAt), approved (reviewedAt), shipped (shippedAt), completed (completedAt)
- Returns array sorted by date

**Branch Dependencies**:
- `groupBy(['sourceBranchId', 'destinationBranchId'])`
- Fetches branch names
- Calculates total units from items

**Top Routes**:
- Similar to branch dependencies
- Includes avg completion time (requestedAt → completedAt)
- Limited to top 10 by default

**Status Distribution**:
- `groupBy(['status'])`
- Returns object keyed by status

**Bottlenecks**:
- Calculates avg time for each stage: approval, shipping, receipt
- Only includes completed transfers

**Product Frequency**:
- Queries all transfer items in date range
- Groups by productId
- Tracks top 3 routes per product

---

### Priority Sorting

**List Endpoint Sorting**:
```typescript
const orderBy = [
  { priority: 'desc' }, // URGENT → HIGH → NORMAL → LOW
  { requestedAt: 'desc' }, // Then by requested date
  { id: 'desc' }, // Tie-breaker
];
```

**Priority Update Validation**:
1. Transfer must be REQUESTED or APPROVED
2. User must be member of source OR destination branch
3. Creates audit event with before/after values

---

### Partial Shipment Logic

**Status Transition**:
```
APPROVED ──(partial ship)──> APPROVED (qtyShipped < qtyApproved)
         ──(full ship)───> IN_TRANSIT (qtyShipped >= qtyApproved)
```

**Batch Tracking**:
```json
{
  "shipmentBatches": [
    {
      "batchNumber": 1,
      "qty": 5,
      "shippedAt": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z",
      "shippedByUserId": "uuid",
      "lotsConsumed": [
        { "lotId": "uuid", "qty": 5, "unitCostPence": 1000 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "batchNumber": 2,
      "qty": 5,
      "shippedAt": "2025-10-14T12:00:00Z",
      "shippedByUserId": "uuid",
      "lotsConsumed": [
        { "lotId": "uuid", "qty": 5, "unitCostPence": 1100 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Weighted Average Cost**:
```typescript
// First batch: 5 units @ 1000 pence = 5000 total
// Second batch: 5 units @ 1100 pence = 5500 total
// Combined: 10 units @ (5000 + 5500) / 10 = 1050 pence average
```

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing with Swagger UI

1. Start API server: `cd api-server && npm run dev`
2. Open Swagger UI: `http://localhost:4000/docs`
3. Sign in as OWNER or ADMIN (both have `reports:view`)

**Test Analytics**:
- Navigate to "Analytics" tag
- Test each endpoint with different date ranges
- Verify all metrics return correct values

**Test Priority**:
- Create transfer with `priority: "URGENT"`
- List transfers and verify priority sorting
- Update priority using PATCH endpoint
- Verify audit event created

**Test Partial Shipment**:
- Create transfer with 2 items (10 units each)
- Approve transfer
- Ship partial: `{ "items": [{ "itemId": "...", "qtyToShip": 5 }] }`
- Verify status stays APPROVED
- Ship remaining quantity
- Verify status changes to IN_TRANSIT
- Check `shipmentBatches` has 2 entries

---

### curl Examples

#### Get Overview Metrics
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/stock-transfers/analytics/overview?startDate=2025-01-01&endDate=2025-12-31" \
  -H "Cookie: mt_session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

#### Update Priority
```bash
curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:4000/api/stock-transfers/TRANSFER_ID/priority" \
  -H "Cookie: mt_session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"priority":"URGENT"}'
```

#### Ship Partial
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/api/stock-transfers/TRANSFER_ID/ship" \
  -H "Cookie: mt_session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"items":[{"itemId":"ITEM_ID","qtyToShip":5}]}'
```

## TypeScript Issues Resolved

1. **`reports:view` not recognized**: Added to `utils/permissions.ts`
2. **Date string array access**: Added non-null assertions `.split('T')[0]!`
3. **`Errors.permissionDenied()` parameter**: Removed parameter (function accepts none)
4. **Empty `_sum` object**: Removed unused `_sum` property from groupBy

**Final Status**: ✅ TypeScript compilation passed with no errors

---

## Next Steps for Frontend

### What You'll Need to Build

#### 1. Analytics Dashboard
- 7 endpoints available under `/api/stock-transfers/analytics`
- Permission required: `reports:view`
- Date range picker with 30-day default

**Recommended Components**:
- Overview: 4 metric cards
- Volume Chart: Line chart (4 series)
- Branch Dependencies: Network graph or table
- Top Routes: Data table
- Status Distribution: Pie chart
- Bottlenecks: Bar chart (3 bars)
- Product Frequency: Data table

#### 2. Priority Field UI
- Badge component with color coding:
  - URGENT: Red
  - HIGH: Orange
  - NORMAL: Blue
  - LOW: Gray
- Dropdown for editing (REQUESTED/APPROVED only)
- List view auto-sorts by priority

#### 3. Partial Shipment UI
- Show approved quantities
- Allow user to enter "Qty to Ship"
- Show "Already Shipped" counter
- Display shipment history (batches)
- Show "Partial" badge if incomplete

## Performance Notes

### Analytics Queries
- Real-time calculation (no pre-aggregation)
- Uses `requestedAt` index for date filtering
- Branch filtering uses composite index

### Future Optimizations
- Materialized views for large datasets
- Caching with 5-15 minute TTL
- Background jobs for complex metrics

---

## Security

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- All queries filter by `tenantId`
- Middleware ensures `req.currentTenantId` is set

### RBAC Enforcement
- Analytics: `reports:view`
- Priority/Ship: `stock:write`
- Branch membership checked for priority updates

### Audit Trail
- `TRANSFER_PRIORITY_CHANGE` for priority updates
- `TRANSFER_SHIP_PARTIAL` for partial shipments
- `TRANSFER_SHIP` for full shipments

---
