# Stock Transfer Enhancements - Implementation Plan

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planning
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days
**Created:** 2025-10-24
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24

## Overview

This feature enhances the existing stock transfer system with improved reversal tracking, delivery planning, and bidirectional workflow support. Users will be able to track reversal relationships across transfers, plan deliveries with expected dates, add detailed order notes, and initiate transfers in both directions (push stock to branches OR request stock from branches).

**Key Capabilities:**
- Bidirectional reversal linking with reason propagation across related transfers
- Expected/requested delivery date tracking for better operational planning
- Order notes for communication between branches during transfer workflow
- Dual-direction transfer initiation (push to others OR pull from others)

**Related Documentation:**
- [Stock Transfer System](../../System/stock-transfers.md) - Current implementation
- [Database Schema](../../System/database-schema.md) - Prisma models reference
- [Testing Overview](../../SOP/testing_overview.md) - Testing procedures

## Phase 1: Core Data Model Extensions

**Goal:** Extend database schema with new fields for delivery dates, notes, and bidirectional reversal links

**Relevant Files:**
- [api-server/prisma/schema.prisma](../../../api-server/prisma/schema.prisma) - Lines 387-446 (StockTransfer model)
- [api-server/src/services/stockTransfers/stockTransferService.ts](../../../api-server/src/services/stockTransfers/stockTransferService.ts)
- [api-server/src/openapi/paths/stockTransfers.ts](../../../api-server/src/openapi/paths/stockTransfers.ts)

- [ ] Backend tests passing
  - Test bidirectional link creation on reversal
  - Test reversal reason propagation to orderNotes
  - Test querying reversal relationships in both directions
  - Test multiple reversals (reversal of reversal) - ensure chain integrity

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests (Jest)

**Service Layer:**
- [ ] Expected delivery date validation (must be future date if provided)
- [ ] Order notes max length constraints
- [ ] Bidirectional reversal link creation and integrity
- [ ] Reversal reason propagation to orderNotes
- [ ] Initiation type access control (PUSH vs PULL)
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation with all new fields
- [ ] Edge case: reversal of reversal (chain integrity)
- [ ] Edge case: transfer with delivery date in past (validation error)

**API Routes:**
- [ ] Create transfer with new fields (authenticated request)
- [ ] List transfers filtered by delivery date range
- [ ] List transfers filtered by initiation type and initiatedByMe
- [ ] Get transfer with reversal relationships loaded
- [ ] Permission middleware enforcement (stock:read, stock:write)
- [ ] Request validation for new fields

### Frontend Tests (Playwright E2E)

**User Flows:**
- [ ] Create PUSH transfer with delivery date and order notes
- [ ] Create PULL transfer (request from another branch)
- [ ] Filter transfers by expected delivery date range
- [ ] Filter transfers by initiation type
- [ ] Filter transfers by "Initiated by me"
- [ ] Reverse transfer and verify bidirectional links appear
- [ ] Verify reversal reason appears on both original and reversal transfers
- [ ] Navigate between reversal-linked transfers via UI links

**Permission-Based UI:**
- [ ] OWNER: Can create, approve, ship, receive, reverse transfers
- [ ] ADMIN: Can create, approve, ship, receive, reverse transfers
- [ ] EDITOR: Can create, ship, receive (no approve/reverse)
- [ ] VIEWER: Read-only access (no create/modify actions)

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All new fields stored and retrieved correctly across transfer lifecycle
- [ ] Reversal creates bidirectional links visible in UI on both transfers
- [ ] Users can create transfers in both directions (PUSH and PULL)
- [ ] Expected delivery date filters work accurately
- [ ] All existing transfer E2E tests still pass (no regressions)
- [ ] All backend Jest tests pass (227+ tests)
- [ ] All frontend Playwright tests pass (124+ tests)

---

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Reversal Reason Storage**: Store reversal reason in `orderNotes` field of reversal transfer with prefix "Reversal of TRF-YYYY-NNNN: {reason}" to maintain single source of truth while keeping reason visible
- **Initiation Type Default**: Default to `PUSH` (existing behavior) to maintain backward compatibility with current workflows
- **Expected Delivery Date**: Optional field, no validation for past dates on existing transfers (only on creation/update)
- **Access Control**: PUSH requires source membership for create, destination for approve; PULL reverses this logic
- **Bidirectional Links**: Both `reversalOfId` and `reversedByTransferId` stored for efficient queries in both directions

**Known Limitations:**
- Expected delivery date is planning-only (no automatic notifications when date approaches)
- Reversal reason limited to text (no structured reason codes)
- Initiation type cannot be changed after transfer creation
- No validation for delivery date conflicts (multiple transfers to same branch on same day)

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Delivery date notifications/alerts
- Structured reversal reason taxonomy
- Automatic delivery scheduling/routing
- Capacity planning based on expected delivery dates
- PDF generation for dispatch notes and purchase orders (separate feature)
