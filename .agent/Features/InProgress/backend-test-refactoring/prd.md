# Backend Test Refactoring - Master Implementation Plan

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planning
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 10-15 days (across 5 PRDs)
**Created:** 2025-10-21
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21

## Overview

Comprehensive refactoring of 39 backend test files into a feature-based, hierarchical organization with complete RBAC coverage and standardized test patterns. This initiative will establish a maintainable test structure, create comprehensive permission test coverage, and fill gaps in middleware and feature testing.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Standardized test template ensuring consistency across all 227+ backend tests
- Feature-based organization mirroring src/ directory structure for easy navigation
- Comprehensive RBAC permission testing (12 new test files covering all roles Ã— all endpoints)
- Complete middleware test coverage (3 new test files for previously untested middleware)
- Full service and route coverage for all features (~20 new test files)

## Testing Strategy

### Standardization Approach

**Test Template Document:**
- Markdown reference document for consistent test structure
- Service test pattern (business logic, multi-tenancy, validation)
- Route test pattern (HTTP layer, envelope format, minimal permissions)
- Permission test pattern (matrix testing: all roles Ã— all endpoints)

**Directory Organization:**
```
__tests__/
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/              # Shared test utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/             # Test data
â”œâ”€â”€ setup/                # Global setup/teardown
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                 # Health, auth core tests
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/           # Middleware-specific tests
â”œâ”€â”€ permissions/          # RBAC permission tests (NEW - 12 files)
â””â”€â”€ features/             # Feature-organized tests
    â”œâ”€â”€ products/
    â”œâ”€â”€ stock/
    â”œâ”€â”€ branches/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tenantUsers/
    â”œâ”€â”€ roles/
    â”œâ”€â”€ theme/
    â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/
    â”œâ”€â”€ auditLogs/
    â”œâ”€â”€ stockTransfers/
    â”œâ”€â”€ transferAnalytics/
    â”œâ”€â”€ featureFlags/
    â””â”€â”€ chat/
```

### Test Isolation Pattern

**Use `testContext` for cleanup:**
- Initialize in `beforeEach` â†’ cleanup in `afterEach`
- Track all created entities for automatic deletion
- Prevent test interference and data pollution

**Database Strategy:**
- Tests run against dev database (safe with timestamps)
- Use factory helpers with `Date.now()` for unique data
- No cleanup needed by default (timestamp-based uniqueness)

### Permission Testing Strategy

**Matrix Coverage:**
- Test EVERY endpoint with EVERY role (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER, custom roles)
- Test unauthenticated requests (401)
- Test unauthorized requests (403)
- Test cross-tenant isolation

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Permission tests in `permissions/` directory (comprehensive RBAC)
- Route tests include minimal permission checks (1 happy path, 1 denied path)
- Service tests focus on business logic (no permission layer)

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Feature-based organization**
   - **Rationale:** Mirror src/ directory structure for intuitive navigation; easier to find tests
   - **Alternative considered:** Keep flat routes/ and services/ structure (rejected: hard to navigate at scale)

2. **Separate permissions/ directory**
   - **Rationale:** RBAC testing is cross-cutting concern; matrix testing needs dedicated space
   - **Alternative considered:** Embed in route tests (rejected: creates massive route test files)

3. **Test template as markdown document**
   - **Rationale:** Living reference that's easy to update; not enforced by tooling but by convention
   - **Alternative considered:** Code generator (rejected: adds complexity, reduces flexibility)

4. **Split into 5 sub-PRDs**
   - **Rationale:** Work is too large for single PRD; enables parallel work and clear milestones
   - **Alternative considered:** Single massive PRD (rejected: overwhelming, hard to track)

5. **Backend-only refactoring**
   - **Rationale:** Frontend E2E tests recently refactored (Oct 2025); focus on backend gaps
   - **Alternative considered:** Full-stack refactor (rejected: too large, frontend already done)

**Known Limitations:**
- Refactoring may temporarily break test references in documentation (update SOPs afterward)
- Moving 39 files will create large git diff (use clear commit messages per PRD)
- Some existing tests may need significant refactoring to match new patterns

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Automated test generation from OpenAPI schemas
- Contract testing between frontend and backend
- Mutation testing for test quality validation
- Performance/load testing infrastructure
- Visual regression testing for E2E

## Implementation Sequence

**Recommended Order:**
1. **PRD 1** (Template & Structure) - Foundation for all other work
2. **PRD 3** (Middleware) - Quick win, fills obvious gaps
3. **PRD 2** (Permissions) - High value, comprehensive coverage
4. **PRD 4** (Core Features) - Essential service/route coverage
5. **PRD 5** (Advanced Features) - Complete remaining coverage

**Rationale:** Build foundation first (template + structure), then layer in missing tests (middleware â†’ permissions â†’ features)

**Parallelization Opportunities:**
- After PRD 1 complete, PRD 2-5 can be worked in parallel
- Within each PRD, phases are independent and can be parallelized
