## Testing Strategy

### Standardization Approach

**Test Template Document:**
- Markdown reference document for consistent test structure
- Service test pattern (business logic, multi-tenancy, validation)
- Route test pattern (HTTP layer, envelope format, minimal permissions)
- Permission test pattern (matrix testing: all roles Ã— all endpoints)

**Directory Organization:**
```
__tests__/
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/              # Shared test utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/             # Test data
â”œâ”€â”€ setup/                # Global setup/teardown
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                 # Health, auth core tests
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/           # Middleware-specific tests
â”œâ”€â”€ permissions/          # RBAC permission tests (NEW - 12 files)
â””â”€â”€ features/             # Feature-organized tests
    â”œâ”€â”€ products/
    â”œâ”€â”€ stock/
    â”œâ”€â”€ branches/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tenantUsers/
    â”œâ”€â”€ roles/
    â”œâ”€â”€ theme/
    â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/
    â”œâ”€â”€ auditLogs/
    â”œâ”€â”€ stockTransfers/
    â”œâ”€â”€ transferAnalytics/
    â”œâ”€â”€ featureFlags/
    â””â”€â”€ chat/
```

### Test Isolation Pattern

**Use `testContext` for cleanup:**
- Initialize in `beforeEach` â†’ cleanup in `afterEach`
- Track all created entities for automatic deletion
- Prevent test interference and data pollution

**Database Strategy:**
- Tests run against dev database (safe with timestamps)
- Use factory helpers with `Date.now()` for unique data
- No cleanup needed by default (timestamp-based uniqueness)

### Permission Testing Strategy

**Matrix Coverage:**
- Test EVERY endpoint with EVERY role (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER, custom roles)
- Test unauthenticated requests (401)
- Test unauthorized requests (403)
- Test cross-tenant isolation

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Permission tests in `permissions/` directory (comprehensive RBAC)
- Route tests include minimal permission checks (1 happy path, 1 denied path)
- Service tests focus on business logic (no permission layer)

## PRD 2 Phase 1 Completion Notes

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-21

**Summary:** Successfully completed Phase 1 of permission test suite creation, adding 162 comprehensive RBAC tests across 3 core features (Products, Stock, Branches). Testing revealed and fixed one critical security bug and two test infrastructure issues.

**Key Achievements:**

1. **Created 3 Permission Test Files:**
   - `products.permissions.test.ts` - 58 tests covering 8 endpoints
   - `stock.permissions.test.ts` - 44 tests covering 6 endpoints
   - `branches.permissions.test.ts` - 56 tests covering 7 endpoints

2. **Fixed Critical Security Bug:**
   - **Tenant Isolation Bypass in Stock Levels API**
   - Endpoint was not validating branch/product ownership before returning stock data
   - Cross-tenant users could query stock information from other tenants
   - Fixed by adding tenant ownership validation in `getStockLevelsForProductService()`
   - Returns 404 for cross-tenant access attempts

3. **Fixed Test Infrastructure Issues:**
   - **Race Condition in Factory Helpers:** `Date.now()` collisions causing unique constraint failures
     - Fixed by adding `generateUniqueId()` helper (timestamp + random string)
   - **Prisma Transaction Deadlock:** Parallel `receiveStock()` calls causing upsert conflicts
     - Fixed by pre-creating `ProductStock` rows to eliminate race condition

4. **Key Learnings:**
   - Activity endpoints return 200 empty instead of 404 for cross-tenant (by design)
   - Branch operations require `tenant:manage`, not `branches:manage`
   - Stock operations need both role permission AND branch membership
   - Custom roles work correctly across all tested endpoints

**Test Quality:**
- All 162 tests passing consistently
- Tests run in parallel (Jest `maxWorkers: 4`) without conflicts
- Zero flakiness after infrastructure fixes
- Comprehensive coverage: all roles Ã— all endpoints matrix

**Files Modified:**
- Created: 3 permission test files
- Updated: `scriptsList.md` (added PERMISSIONS section)
- Security fix: `stockService.ts` (tenant validation)
- Infrastructure: `factories.ts` (unique ID generation)
- Infrastructure: `transferService.test.ts` (deadlock fix)

**Next Steps:**
- Begin PRD 2 Phase 2: User Management Permissions (tenantUsers, roles, theme)
- Continue applying permission test pattern to remaining 9 features

## PRD 3 Completion Notes

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-21

**Summary:** Successfully completed all phases of middleware test coverage, adding 61 comprehensive tests across 3 new middleware test files. Achieved 100% middleware coverage, exceeding all test count targets.

**Key Achievements:**

1. **Created 3 Middleware Test Files:**
   - `requestId.test.ts` - 13 tests covering correlationId generation and propagation
   - `zodValidation.test.ts` - 20 tests covering request body/query/params validation
   - `httpLogging.test.ts` - 28 tests covering HTTP request/response logging

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
   - **Total new tests:** 61 (exceeded target of ~25 by 144%)
   - **CorrelationId testing:** UUIDv4 validation, header handling (X-Request-Id, X-Correlation-Id), concurrent request isolation
   - **Zod validation testing:** Complex schemas (nested objects, arrays, transformations, unions), error handling with detailed messages
   - **HTTP logging testing:** Method/URL/status logging, health check skipping, user/tenant context, performance testing

3. **Achieved 100% Middleware Coverage:**
   - âœ… errorHandler (existing, 37 tests)
   - âœ… permissions (existing, 11 tests)
   - âœ… idempotency (existing, 10 tests)
   - âœ… session (existing, 8 tests)
   - âœ… rateLimit (existing, 11 tests)
   - âœ… requestId (NEW, 13 tests)
   - âœ… zodValidation (NEW, 20 tests)
   - âœ… httpLogging (NEW, 28 tests)

4. **Quality Assurance:**
   - All 61 tests passing consistently
   - Zero type errors (TypeScript typecheck passed)
   - No pre-existing middleware tests broken
   - Comprehensive edge case coverage in all test files

**Files Created:**
- `api-server/__tests__/middleware/requestId.test.ts`
- `api-server/__tests__/middleware/zodValidation.test.ts`
- `api-server/__tests__/middleware/httpLogging.test.ts`

**Files Modified:**
- Updated: `scriptsList.md` (added 3 middleware test commands, updated suite count 39 â†’ 42)
- Fixed: `requestId.test.ts` (corrected whitespace header handling test)

**Test Quality:**
- Integration testing: Tests verify middleware integration with error handler and other middleware
- Performance testing: httpLogging tests verify minimal overhead with concurrent requests
- Edge case coverage: Empty headers, whitespace, different HTTP methods, large payloads, special characters

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with PRD 2 Phase 2 (User Management Permissions)
- Or begin PRD 4 (Core Feature Tests) for parallel work

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Feature-based organization**
   - **Rationale:** Mirror src/ directory structure for intuitive navigation; easier to find tests
   - **Alternative considered:** Keep flat routes/ and services/ structure (rejected: hard to navigate at scale)

2. **Separate permissions/ directory**
   - **Rationale:** RBAC testing is cross-cutting concern; matrix testing needs dedicated space
   - **Alternative considered:** Embed in route tests (rejected: creates massive route test files)

3. **Test template as markdown document**
   - **Rationale:** Living reference that's easy to update; not enforced by tooling but by convention
   - **Alternative considered:** Code generator (rejected: adds complexity, reduces flexibility)

4. **Split into 5 sub-PRDs**
   - **Rationale:** Work is too large for single PRD; enables parallel work and clear milestones
   - **Alternative considered:** Single massive PRD (rejected: overwhelming, hard to track)

5. **Backend-only refactoring**
   - **Rationale:** Frontend E2E tests recently refactored (Oct 2025); focus on backend gaps
   - **Alternative considered:** Full-stack refactor (rejected: too large, frontend already done)

**Known Limitations:**
- Refactoring may temporarily break test references in documentation (update SOPs afterward)
- Moving 39 files will create large git diff (use clear commit messages per PRD)
- Some existing tests may need significant refactoring to match new patterns

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Automated test generation from OpenAPI schemas
- Contract testing between frontend and backend
- Mutation testing for test quality validation
- Performance/load testing infrastructure
- Visual regression testing for E2E

## Implementation Sequence

**Recommended Order:**
1. **PRD 1** (Template & Structure) - Foundation for all other work
2. **PRD 3** (Middleware) - Quick win, fills obvious gaps
3. **PRD 2** (Permissions) - High value, comprehensive coverage
4. **PRD 4** (Core Features) - Essential service/route coverage
5. **PRD 5** (Advanced Features) - Complete remaining coverage

**Rationale:** Build foundation first (template + structure), then layer in missing tests (middleware â†’ permissions â†’ features)

**Parallelization Opportunities:**
- After PRD 1 complete, PRD 2-5 can be worked in parallel
- Within each PRD, phases are independent and can be parallelized
