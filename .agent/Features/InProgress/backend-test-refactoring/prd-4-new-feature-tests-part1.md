## Overview

Add missing service and route tests for core business features (Branches, Tenant Users, Roles, Auth Service). These are foundational features with significant coverage gaps that need comprehensive testing.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Complete CRUD testing for branch management
- Full tenant user lifecycle testing (invite, manage, archive, restore)
- Role management testing with permission assignment
- Authentication service testing (sign-in, sign-out, session management)

**Related Documentation:**
- [RBAC System](../../../System/rbac-system.md) - Roles and permissions
- [Database Schema](../../../System/database-schema.md) - Data model
- [Backend Testing Guide](../../../SOP/backend-testing.md) - Testing patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Service Tests (Business Logic)

**Pattern:**
- Test service functions directly (no HTTP layer)
- Focus on business logic, validation, data transformations
- Test multi-tenant isolation thoroughly
- Test error cases and edge cases
- Verify audit log creation
- Use factory helpers for test data

**Coverage:**
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Restore)
- Business rules and constraints
- Error handling
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Audit trail

### Route Tests (HTTP Layer)

**Pattern:**
- Test Express router with middleware
- Use supertest for HTTP requests
- Test request validation (Zod)
- Test response format (envelope)
- Minimal permission testing (1 happy, 1 denied)
- Test authentication requirement

**Coverage:**
- All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Request validation
- Response format
- Authentication (401)
- Basic authorization (403)
- Idempotency where applicable

- [ ] roleRoutes.test.ts: 10+ tests passing
- [ ] authService.test.ts: 12+ tests passing
- [ ] All new tests passing (~70+ new tests total)
- [ ] Coverage gaps filled for core features
- [ ] Service and route test patterns documented in TEST_TEMPLATE.md

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Separate service and route tests**
   - **Rationale:** Service tests focus on business logic; route tests focus on HTTP layer
   - **Alternative:** Combined tests (rejected: mixes concerns, hard to debug)

2. **Minimal permission testing in route tests**
   - **Rationale:** Full permission coverage in permissions/ directory
   - **Alternative:** Full matrix in route tests (rejected: duplicates permission tests)

3. **Test branch membership requirements**
   - **Rationale:** Stock operations require UserBranchMembership, critical to test
   - **Alternative:** Skip branch membership (rejected: incomplete coverage)

4. **Test system role protection**
   - **Rationale:** Security-critical to prevent accidental deletion of system roles
   - **Alternative:** Only test custom roles (rejected: incomplete coverage)

5. **Auth service testing separate from route tests**
   - **Rationale:** Service layer has complex logic (bcrypt, JWT) deserving dedicated tests
   - **Alternative:** Only test via routes (rejected: black-box testing insufficient)

**Known Limitations:**
- Cannot test branch deletion if active stock exists (requires complex setup)
- Some edge cases require multiple tenants (more test data overhead)
- Password hashing tests are slow (bcrypt is intentionally slow)

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Branch hierarchy support (parent/child branches)
- Bulk user invite functionality
- Role templates (pre-defined role configurations)
- SSO integration testing
