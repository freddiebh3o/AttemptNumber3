**Key Capabilities:**
- Complete CRUD testing for branch management
- Full tenant user lifecycle testing (invite, manage, archive, restore)
- Role management testing with permission assignment
- Authentication service testing (sign-in, sign-out, session management)

## Testing Strategy

### Service Tests (Business Logic)

**Pattern:**
- Test service functions directly (no HTTP layer)
- Focus on business logic, validation, data transformations
- Test multi-tenant isolation thoroughly
- Test error cases and edge cases
- Verify audit log creation
- Use factory helpers for test data

**Coverage:**
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Restore)
- Business rules and constraints
- Error handling
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Audit trail

### Route Tests (HTTP Layer)

**Pattern:**
- Test Express router with middleware
- Use supertest for HTTP requests
- Test request validation (Zod)
- Test response format (envelope)
- Minimal permission testing (1 happy, 1 denied)
- Test authentication requirement

**Coverage:**
- All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Request validation
- Response format
- Authentication (401)
- Basic authorization (403)
- Idempotency where applicable

---

## Success Metrics

- [x] 6 new test files created (4 service + 2 route) ✅
- [x] branchService.test.ts: 30+ tests passing ✅ (exceeded target)
- [x] branchRoutes.test.ts: 28 tests passing ✅ (exceeded target)
- [x] tenantUserService.test.ts: 33+ tests passing ✅ (exceeded target)

- [x] Service and route test patterns applied from TEST_TEMPLATE.md ✅
- [x] scriptsList.md updated with all new test suites ✅

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Separate service and route tests**
   - **Rationale:** Service tests focus on business logic; route tests focus on HTTP layer
   - **Alternative:** Combined tests (rejected: mixes concerns, hard to debug)

2. **Minimal permission testing in route tests**
   - **Rationale:** Full permission coverage in permissions/ directory
   - **Alternative:** Full matrix in route tests (rejected: duplicates permission tests)

3. **Test branch membership requirements**
   - **Rationale:** Stock operations require UserBranchMembership, critical to test
   - **Alternative:** Skip branch membership (rejected: incomplete coverage)

4. **Test system role protection**
   - **Rationale:** Security-critical to prevent accidental deletion of system roles
   - **Alternative:** Only test custom roles (rejected: incomplete coverage)

5. **Auth service testing separate from route tests**
   - **Rationale:** Service layer has complex logic (bcrypt, JWT) deserving dedicated tests
   - **Alternative:** Only test via routes (rejected: black-box testing insufficient)

**Known Limitations:**
- Cannot test branch deletion if active stock exists (requires complex setup)
- Some edge cases require multiple tenants (more test data overhead)
- Password hashing tests are slow (bcrypt is intentionally slow)

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Branch hierarchy support (parent/child branches)
- Bulk user invite functionality
- Role templates (pre-defined role configurations)
- SSO integration testing

## PRD 4 Completion Notes

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-21

**Summary:** Successfully completed all 4 phases of core feature testing, adding 169+ comprehensive tests across 6 new test files (4 service + 2 route). Exceeded all test count targets by 141% and filled critical coverage gaps for branches, tenant users, roles, and authentication services.

**Key Achievements:**

1. **Created 6 New Test Files:**
   - `branchService.test.ts` - 30+ tests covering CRUD, archival, multi-tenant isolation
   - `branchRoutes.test.ts` - 28 tests covering HTTP layer, validation, permissions
   - `tenantUserService.test.ts` - 33+ tests covering invites, roles, branch assignments
   - `roleService.test.ts` - 29 tests covering role management, permissions, system role protection
   - `roleRoutes.test.ts` - 24 tests covering role HTTP API
   - `authService.test.ts` - 25+ tests covering sign-in, password security, multi-tenant auth

2. **Test Quality & Coverage:**
   - **Total new tests:** 169+ (exceeded target of 70+ by 141%)
   - **All tests passing** with zero flakiness
   - **Comprehensive coverage:** CRUD operations, business rules, multi-tenant isolation, audit logging
   - **Security testing:** Password hashing (bcrypt), timing-safe comparisons, RBAC enforcement

3. **Key Fixes & Learnings:**
   - **RBAC Permission Alignment:**
     - Branch routes require `tenant:manage` (not `branches:manage`)
     - Role routes require `roles:manage` (OWNER-only permission)
     - Tests updated to use OWNER role where needed
   - **System Role Protection:**
     - Created test patterns for verifying system roles cannot be modified/archived
     - Tests properly create and mark roles as system with `isSystem: true`
   - **Error Message Matching:**
     - Fixed error expectations to match actual service messages
     - "Invalid role" vs "not found" for cross-tenant validation
     - "Unknown permission key" for invalid permission references
   - **Response Envelope Format:**
     - Success responses include `error: null` by design (consistent shape)
     - Tests updated to expect full envelope: `{success, data, error}`

4. **Test Patterns Established:**
   - **Service Tests:** Focus on business logic, direct function calls, no HTTP layer
   - **Route Tests:** Focus on HTTP layer, request validation, response format, minimal permission checks
   - **Factory Helpers:** Used extensively for test data creation with unique IDs
   - **Audit Logging:** Verified audit trail creation for all mutating operations
   - **Multi-Tenant Isolation:** Comprehensive cross-tenant access prevention testing

**Files Created:**
- `api-server/__tests__/features/branches/branchService.test.ts`
- `api-server/__tests__/features/branches/branchRoutes.test.ts`
- `api-server/__tests__/features/tenantUsers/tenantUserService.test.ts`
- `api-server/__tests__/features/roles/roleService.test.ts`
- `api-server/__tests__/features/roles/roleRoutes.test.ts`
- `api-server/__tests__/features/auth/authService.test.ts`

**Files Modified:**
- Updated: `scriptsList.md` (added 6 new test suites, updated counts)
  - FEATURES: BRANCHES: 1 → 3 suites
  - FEATURES: TENANT USERS: 2 → 3 suites
  - FEATURES: ROLES: 1 → 3 suites
  - FEATURES: AUTH: 0 → 1 suite (new section)
  - Total suites: 51 → 57

**Test Execution Results:**
- All 169+ new tests passing consistently
- No flakiness observed after fixes
- Tests run in parallel without conflicts
- Zero TypeScript type errors

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with PRD 5 (Advanced Feature Tests) for remaining features
- Or prioritize other backend refactoring tasks
