# PRD 2: Permission Test Suite Creation

**Status:** ✅ Complete (All 4 Phases Complete)
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 days
**Created:** 2025-10-21
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Completed:** 2025-10-21

## Overview

Build comprehensive RBAC permission test suite covering all 12 features with matrix testing of all endpoints against all roles (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER, custom roles). This ensures complete permission enforcement coverage and catches authorization bugs early.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Matrix testing: Every endpoint × Every role = Complete permission coverage
- Separate permission tests from functional route tests (separation of concerns)
- Test unauthenticated requests (401 errors)
- Test cross-tenant isolation for all features
- Comprehensive custom role permission testing

**Related Documentation:**
- [RBAC System](../../../System/rbac-system.md) - Permission catalog and role definitions
- [RBAC Catalog Source](../../../../api-server/src/rbac/catalog.ts) - Permission keys and role mappings
- [Test Template](../../../../api-server/__tests__/TEST_TEMPLATE.md) - Permission test pattern
- [Master PRD](./prd.md) - Overall refactoring plan

---

## Testing Strategy

### Permission Matrix Pattern

**For each endpoint, test:**
```typescript
describe('[RBAC] Feature Permissions', () => {
  describe('GET /api/endpoint - Action', () => {
    it('OWNER - should allow access', async () => { ... });
    it('ADMIN - should allow access', async () => { ... });
    it('EDITOR - should allow access (if has permission)', async () => { ... });
    it('VIEWER - should deny (lacks permission)', async () => { ... });
    it('Custom role with permission - should allow', async () => { ... });
    it('Custom role without permission - should deny', async () => { ... });
    it('No membership - should deny (403)', async () => { ... });
    it('Unauthenticated - should deny (401)', async () => { ... });
    it('Cross-tenant access - should deny (404)', async () => { ... });
  });
});
```

### Test Data Setup

**Use factories for consistent setup:**
- Create test tenant
- Create users with each role (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER)
- Create session cookies for each user
- Create test resources (products, branches, etc.)
- Create resources in other tenant for cross-tenant tests

### Expected Outcomes

**Permission enforcement:**
- 200/201: User has required permission
- 401: Unauthenticated (no session cookie)
- 403: Authenticated but lacks permission
- 404: Cross-tenant access (resource not found in user's tenant)

## Phase 1 Completion Summary

**Files Created:**
- `api-server/__tests__/permissions/products.permissions.test.ts` - 58 tests
- `api-server/__tests__/permissions/stock.permissions.test.ts` - 44 tests
- `api-server/__tests__/permissions/branches.permissions.test.ts` - 56 tests
- Updated `api-server/__tests__/scriptsList.md` with new PERMISSIONS section

**Total Tests Added:** 162 permission tests (all passing ✅)

**Bugs Fixed During Testing:**

1. **Critical Security Bug: Tenant Isolation Bypass in Stock Levels**
   - **Location:** `api-server/src/services/stockService.ts` - `getStockLevelsForProductService()`
   - **Issue:** Endpoint was not validating that `branchId` and `productId` belonged to the current tenant
   - **Impact:** Cross-tenant users could query stock levels for branches/products from other tenants
   - **Fix:** Added tenant ownership validation before querying stock data (returns 404 for cross-tenant access)
   - **File Modified:** [api-server/src/services/stockService.ts](../../../../api-server/src/services/stockService.ts#L724-L741)

2. **Test Infrastructure: Race Condition in Factory Helpers**
   - **Location:** `api-server/__tests__/helpers/factories.ts`
   - **Issue:** `Date.now()` timestamps caused unique constraint failures when tests ran in parallel
   - **Impact:** Intermittent test failures with "Unique constraint failed on userEmailAddress"
   - **Fix:** Added `generateUniqueId()` helper combining timestamp + random string
   - **File Modified:** [api-server/__tests__/helpers/factories.ts](../../../../api-server/__tests__/helpers/factories.ts#L13-L19)

3. **Test Infrastructure: Prisma Transaction Deadlock**
   - **Location:** `api-server/__tests__/features/stockTransfers/transferService.test.ts`
   - **Issue:** Multiple tests' `beforeEach` hooks calling `receiveStock()` simultaneously caused upsert deadlocks
   - **Impact:** Intermittent "Transaction failed due to write conflict or deadlock" errors
   - **Fix:** Pre-create `ProductStock` rows before `receiveStock()` calls to eliminate upsert race condition
   - **File Modified:** [api-server/__tests__/features/stockTransfers/transferService.test.ts](../../../../api-server/__tests__/features/stockTransfers/transferService.test.ts#L74-L93)

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Activity Endpoint Behavior:** Activity endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/products/:id/activity`) return 200 with empty results for cross-tenant requests rather than 404. This is by design - they filter by `tenantId` in service layer.

2. **Branch Permissions:** Branch write operations require `tenant:manage` permission (OWNER only), not `branches:manage` from RBAC catalog. GET endpoints have no permission requirements (all authenticated users allowed).

3. **Stock Operation Authorization:** Stock operations require TWO authorization layers:
   - Role-based permission (`stock:read` or `stock:write`)
   - Branch membership (`UserBranchMembership` record must exist)

4. **Custom Role Testing:** Custom roles with specific permissions work correctly across all endpoints tested.

**Performance:** All 162 permission tests run in parallel (Jest `maxWorkers: 4`) without conflicts after race condition fixes.

## Phase 2 Completion Summary

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-21

**What Was Accomplished:**

     - POST /api/tenant-users (invite/create)
     - PUT /api/tenant-users/:userId (update)
     - DELETE /api/tenant-users/:userId (remove)
     - POST /api/tenant-users/:userId/restore
   - Cross-tenant isolation: 404 for main endpoints, 200 empty for activity

2. ✅ **Created roles.permissions.test.ts** (~56 tests)
   - Tests 8 endpoints with full role matrix
   - Permissions: `roles:manage` (OWNER only)
   - Endpoints tested:
     - GET /api/permissions (list all permissions)
     - GET /api/roles (list roles)
     - GET /api/roles/:roleId (get by ID)
     - GET /api/roles/:roleId/activity

     - PUT /api/roles/:roleId (update role)
     - DELETE /api/roles/:roleId (archive role)
     - POST /api/roles/:roleId/restore
   - Cross-tenant isolation: 404 for main endpoints, 200 empty for activity
   - **Key finding:** Only OWNER has `roles:manage` permission

3. ✅ **Created theme.permissions.test.ts** (~40 tests, 4 skipped)
   - Tests 5 endpoints with full role matrix (1 skipped due to file upload complexity)
   - Permissions: `theme:manage` (OWNER, ADMIN only)
   - Endpoints tested:
     - GET /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/theme
     - PUT /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/theme
     - GET /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/theme/activity
     - GET /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/feature-flags
     - PUT /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/feature-flags
     - POST /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/logo (SKIPPED - file upload requires multipart/form-data testing)
   - Cross-tenant isolation: 404 for main endpoints, 200 empty for activity
   - **Note:** Feature flags managed under theme permission scope

4. ✅ **Updated scriptsList.md**
   - Added 3 new permission test commands
   - Updated total suite count (42 → 45)
   - Added permissions test group command

**Total New Tests:** ~145 permission tests (49 + 56 + 40)

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `api-server/__tests__/permissions/tenantUsers.permissions.test.ts`
- Created: `api-server/__tests__/permissions/roles.permissions.test.ts`
- Created: `api-server/__tests__/permissions/theme.permissions.test.ts`
- Updated: `api-server/__tests__/scriptsList.md`

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Permission Scoping:**
   - `users:manage` → OWNER, ADMIN (user invitation and management)
   - `roles:manage` → OWNER only (role and permission management)
   - `theme:manage` → OWNER, ADMIN (branding, theming, feature flags)

2. **Activity Endpoints:** Consistently return 200 with empty results for cross-tenant requests (by design - filtered in service layer)

3. **Feature Flags:** Managed under `theme:manage` permission (not separate permission)

4. **File Upload Testing:** Logo upload endpoint skipped due to multipart/form-data complexity in supertest

**Test Quality:**
- All tests follow standardized permission test pattern from TEST_TEMPLATE.md
- Comprehensive role matrix coverage (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER + custom roles)
- Cross-tenant isolation verified for all endpoints
- Unauthenticated request testing (401) for all endpoints

**Next Steps:**
- Run tests to verify all ~145 new tests pass ✅ DONE
- Begin Phase 3: System Feature Permissions (uploads, audit logs) ✅ DONE

---

## Phase 3 Completion Summary

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-21

**What Was Accomplished:**

1. ✅ **Created auditLogs.permissions.test.ts** (~22 tests)
   - Tests 3 endpoints with full role matrix
   - Permissions: No specific permission required (all authenticated users)
   - Endpoints tested:
     - GET /api/audit/activities (list with filters)
     - GET /api/audit/activities/:id (get by ID)
     - Query filters: entityType, entityId, userId
   - Cross-tenant isolation: 200 empty results (filtered in service layer)
   - **Bug fixed:** Authentication error handling (401 instead of 500)

2. ⏭️ **Skipped uploads.permissions.test.ts**
   - Reason: Uploads feature not yet implemented in the application
   - Can be added when uploads functionality is built

**Total New Tests:** ~22 permission tests

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `api-server/__tests__/permissions/auditLogs.permissions.test.ts`
- Fixed: `api-server/src/routes/auditLoggerRouter.ts` - Authentication error handling

**Bugs Fixed During Testing:**

1. **Authentication Error Handling in Audit Router**
   - **Location:** `api-server/src/routes/auditLoggerRouter.ts` - `requireTenant()` helper
   - **Issue:** Throwing raw Error object instead of HttpError caused 500 instead of 401
   - **Impact:** Unauthenticated requests returned 500 Internal Server Error
   - **Fix:** Use `Errors.authRequired()` to throw proper HttpError with 401 status
   - **File Modified:** [api-server/src/routes/auditLoggerRouter.ts](../../../../api-server/src/routes/auditLoggerRouter.ts#L24-L30)

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Audit Log Permissions:** Unlike other features, audit logs have NO permission requirements - all authenticated users can view activity logs (filtered by tenant in service layer)

2. **Error Handling Pattern:** Always use `Errors.*()` helper functions instead of throwing raw Error objects to ensure proper HTTP status codes

**Test Quality:**
- All tests follow standardized permission test pattern
- Cross-tenant isolation verified (returns empty results, not 404)
- Unauthenticated request testing (401) for all endpoints

- Created: `api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferApprovals.permissions.test.ts`
- Created: `api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferAnalytics.permissions.test.ts`

**Bugs Fixed During Testing:**

1. **Import Errors in stockTransfers Tests**
   - **Issue:** Test file importing non-existent `createTestBranchMembership` helper
   - **Fix:** Use `addUserToBranch()` instead; move `receiveStock` import to service layer
   - **File Modified:** [api-server/__tests__/permissions/stockTransfers.permissions.test.ts](../../../../api-server/__tests__/permissions/stockTransfers.permissions.test.ts)

2. **Validation Schema Mismatch in transferTemplates**
   - **Issue:** Tests using `qty` field instead of `defaultQty`; expecting 201 instead of 200
   - **Fix:** Updated POST body to use `defaultQty`, changed expected status to 200
   - **File Modified:** [api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferTemplates.permissions.test.ts](../../../../api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferTemplates.permissions.test.ts)

3. **Missing Required Fields in transferApprovals**
   - **Issue:** POST requests missing `requiredRoleId` in approval rule levels
   - **Fix:** Added `ownerRole` variable and included `requiredRoleId` in all POST bodies
   - **File Modified:** [api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferApprovals.permissions.test.ts](../../../../api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferApprovals.permissions.test.ts)

4. **Endpoint Path Mismatch in transferAnalytics**
   - **Issue:** Tests using non-existent endpoints (`/summary`, `/by-branch`, `/by-product`, `/trends`)
   - **Fix:** Updated to actual router endpoints (`/overview`, `/volume-chart`, `/top-routes`, `/product-frequency`)
   - **File Modified:** [api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferAnalytics.permissions.test.ts](../../../../api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferAnalytics.permissions.test.ts)

5. **Wrong Permission Expectations for VIEWER Role**
   - **Issue:** Tests expected VIEWER to have `reports:view` permission
   - **Actual:** VIEWER only has `products:read` and `stock:read`, NOT `reports:view`
   - **Fix:** Changed VIEWER test expectations from 200 to 403 for all analytics endpoints
   - **File Modified:** [api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferAnalytics.permissions.test.ts](../../../../api-server/__tests__/permissions/transferAnalytics.permissions.test.ts)

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Permission Scoping for Transfers:**
   - Read operations: `stock:read` (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER)
   - Write operations: `stock:write` (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR)
   - Reverse transfers: `stock:write` (OWNER, ADMIN only - not EDITOR)
   - Analytics: `reports:view` (OWNER, ADMIN only)

2. **VIEWER Role Limitations:** VIEWER has very limited permissions:
   - `products:read` ✅
   - `stock:read` ✅
   - NO `stock:write` ❌
   - NO `reports:view` ❌
   - NO `users:manage` ❌
   - NO `tenant:manage` ❌

3. **Test Data Requirements:** Transfer tests require:
   - Two branches (source + destination)
   - Test product with stock in source branch
   - Branch memberships for all users performing operations
   - Approval rules require existing roles with IDs

4. **Validation Schemas:** Always check actual Zod schemas in routers to ensure test bodies match exactly

**Test Quality:**
- All tests follow standardized permission test pattern
- Comprehensive role matrix coverage including EDITOR who has mixed permissions
- Branch membership requirements properly tested
- Cross-tenant isolation verified for all endpoints

**Performance:**
- All 136 tests run in ~10-12 seconds with proper parallel execution

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Separate permissions/ directory**
   - **Rationale:** Permission testing is cross-cutting concern; deserves dedicated space
   - **Alternative:** Embed in route tests (rejected: creates massive files, mixes concerns)

2. **Matrix testing approach**
   - **Rationale:** Comprehensive coverage of all roles × all endpoints catches permission bugs
   - **Alternative:** Sample testing (rejected: incomplete coverage, risk of gaps)

3. **Custom role testing**
   - **Rationale:** Real-world usage includes custom roles, must test them too
   - **Alternative:** Only test system roles (rejected: incomplete coverage)

4. **Cross-tenant isolation in permission tests**
   - **Rationale:** Security-critical to verify tenant isolation at permission layer
   - **Alternative:** Test only in service layer (rejected: defense in depth needed)

5. **Test all endpoints, not just write operations**
   - **Rationale:** Read permissions are equally important (data leakage risk)
   - **Alternative:** Only test write operations (rejected: incomplete security coverage)

**Known Limitations:**
- Permission tests are verbose (9+ tests per endpoint)
- Some permission combinations may be redundant (e.g., OWNER has all permissions)
- Test data setup is duplicated across files (opportunity for shared helpers)

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Automated permission test generation from OpenAPI + RBAC catalog
- Permission testing for GraphQL endpoints (if added)
- Fine-grained permission testing (field-level access control)
- Permission testing for bulk operations
