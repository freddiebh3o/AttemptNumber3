## Overview

Enable safe user deactivation by implementing archival at the UserTenantMembership level (per-tenant soft delete). Currently, users cannot be removed from tenants when they have related records (stock movements, transfers, approvals, audit events) due to foreign key constraints. This allows deactivating ex-employees while preserving complete audit trails and historical data.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Archive user memberships instead of hard delete (preserves audit trail)
- Per-tenant archival (user remains active in other tenants)
- Filter archived users from active views with dropdown (active-only, archived-only, all)
- Archive users from user management page with confirmation modal
- Restore archived user memberships (users with users:manage permission)

**Related Documentation:**
- [Database Schema](../../System/database-schema.md#usertenantmembership) - UserTenantMembership model reference
- [RBAC System](../../System/rbac-system.md) - Permission enforcement
- [Product Archival PRD](../Completed/product-archival/prd.md) - Similar implementation pattern

**Problem Being Solved:**
Users with stock movements, transfer history, or approval records cannot be removed from tenants due to foreign key constraints. Soft delete at membership level preserves historical data, maintains audit compliance, and supports security requirements while allowing HR to "remove" ex-employees from active user lists.

**Important Security Note:**
Archived users should not be able to sign in to archived tenant memberships. Archive status must be checked during authentication.

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests (Jest)

**Service Layer:**
- [ ] Archive user membership with stock/transfer history succeeds
- [ ] Archive user membership updates isArchived, archivedAt, archivedByUserId
- [ ] Restore user membership clears archive fields
- [ ] List users excludes archived by default
- [ ] List users with archivedFilter='archived-only' returns only archived
- [ ] List users with archivedFilter='all' returns all users
- [ ] getUserMembership() allows access to archived memberships
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation (cannot archive users in other tenants)
- [ ] Cannot archive own membership (throws error)
- [ ] Audit trail preservation (UPDATE events for archive/restore)

**Authentication:**
- [ ] Archived membership rejected during sign-in (401)
- [ ] Archived membership rejected during session validation (401)
- [ ] User can still sign in to other non-archived tenant memberships

**API Routes:**
- [ ] DELETE /tenant-users/:userId sets isArchived instead of deleting
- [ ] POST /tenant-users/:userId/restore restores archived membership
- [ ] GET /tenant-users with archivedFilter parameter works correctly
- [ ] GET /tenant-users/:userId returns archived memberships (for detail page access)

### Frontend Tests (Playwright E2E)

**User Flows:**
- [ ] Archive user membership from detail page (with confirmation modal)
- [ ] Cancel archive confirmation (verify no changes made)
- [ ] Use archive filter dropdown to show only archived users
- [ ] Use archive filter dropdown to show all users (active + archived)
- [ ] Restore archived user membership from detail page
- [ ] Archived badge displayed correctly in list views
- [ ] Archived users hidden by default in list view
- [ ] Archived users accessible via direct URL to detail page
- [ ] Archive confirmation modal displays with correct messaging
- [ ] Clear archive filter resets to default state

**Security & Permission Tests:**
- [ ] Users with users:manage can archive and restore memberships
- [ ] Users without users:manage (VIEWER) cannot see archive/restore buttons
- [ ] Archive button only shown for active memberships
- [ ] Restore button only shown for archived memberships
- [ ] Cannot archive own membership (button hidden)
- [ ] Archived user receives 401 when attempting to sign in
- [ ] Archived user redirected to sign-in page with error message

- [ ] Backend tests all passing (user service tests + auth tests)
- [ ] Archived users excluded from active views by default
- [ ] Three-way archive filter working (active-only, archived-only, all)
- [ ] Restore functionality working with audit trail

- [ ] Archived users cannot authenticate to archived tenant
- [ ] Archived users accessible on detail pages for restore
- [ ] Archive/restore buttons only visible to users with users:manage
- [ ] Cannot archive own membership (safety check)
- [ ] E2E tests written and passing (comprehensive Playwright tests)
- [ ] User documentation updated with archive workflows and security implications

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Membership-level archival** - Archive at UserTenantMembership level (not global User), allows per-tenant deactivation
- **Authentication blocking** - Archived memberships rejected during sign-in (critical security requirement)
- **Archive terminology** - Using "Archive" in UI instead of "Delete" to clarify it's reversible
- **Three-way filter** - Dropdown with 3 options (active-only, archived-only, all) for better control
- **Archive from detail page** - Archive action on detail page with confirmation modal (consistent with product/branch archival)
- **Confirmation modal** - User-friendly explanation with security warning: "This user will no longer be able to sign in to this tenant. All historical data and audit trails will be preserved. This action can be reversed."
- **Permission level** - Reusing existing `users:manage` permission (no new permission needed)
- **Self-archival prevention** - Cannot archive own membership (safety check to prevent lockout)
- **Optional tracking fields** - Including archivedAt and archivedByUserId for audit trail
- **Archived user access** - Allow detail page access for restoration

**Related Constraints:**
- User global entity remains (not deleted, just membership archived)
- StockLedger.actorUserId uses `onDelete: SetNull` (preserved, actor shown as "Former User" or similar)
- StockTransfer relations use `onDelete: Restrict` or `onDelete: SetNull` (preserved with archive)
- AuditEvent.actorUserId uses `onDelete: SetNull` (preserved, actor shown in audit trail)
- UserBranchMembership should cascade delete when UserTenantMembership archived (or add isArchived to UserBranchMembership)

**Known Limitations:**
- Archived memberships remain in database permanently (not a true delete)
- Email uniqueness constraint at User level (cannot reuse email even if all memberships archived)
- User global entity remains even if all tenant memberships archived (orphan users possible)
- Stock movements/transfers still reference archived user in history (acceptable for audit trail)

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Bulk archive/restore operations
- Scheduled permanent deletion of archived memberships (after X days)
- Archive reasons/notes field (e.g., "Terminated employment", "Role change")
- Archive history timeline (show who archived/restored and when)
- Email notification to archived user
- Cascade archival to UserBranchMembership records
- Global user cleanup (delete User if all memberships archived)
- Re-invitation workflow (restore archived membership when user re-joins company)
