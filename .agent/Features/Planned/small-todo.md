- Remove chat feature fallback (ALready planned)

- Do we need the 'active' value on transfer approvals anymore given we now have the archival functionality. The 'show rules' filter has three options, Active rules only, Active and archived, archived only, however, this 'Active rules only' refers to non archived rules, and not the actual active varialbe on the rule, which would be confusing to the user i imagine.
