- Remove chat feature fallback (ALready planned)

- Do we need the 'active' value on transfer approvals anymore given we now have the archival functionality. The 'show rules' filter has three options, Active rules only, Active and archived, archived only, however, this 'Active rules only' refers to non archived rules, and not the actual active varialbe on the rule, which would be confusing to the user i imagine. 

- Stock transfer additional features:
    - Expected/Requested delivery date
    - Order notes for the stock transfer 
    - You should also be able to initiate a stock transfer from your own branch to another branch aswell as requesting a stock transfer from another branch to your own
    - When a stock transfer is created, we need to create a PDF document for the stock transfer dispatch note, aswell as a purchase order PDF document. Obviously the purchase order will be have a order total of 0 as its just transferring stock between branches

- Fix the 'cancel' button behaviour when creating new entities.
