## Overview

Enhance the existing `isActive` flag on TransferApprovalRule with full archival functionality. Currently, approval rules can be disabled via `isActive: false`, but this still shows them in the UI as "Inactive". True archival completely hides obsolete rules from the UI while preserving them in the database for audit purposes and allowing restoration if needed.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Archive approval rules instead of hard delete (preserves audit trail)
- Full archival on top of existing `isActive` flag (disabled rules can be archived)
- Filter archived rules from active views with dropdown (active-only, archived-only, all)
- Archive rules from rule management page with confirmation modal
- Restore archived rules (users with stock:transfer permission)

**Related Documentation:**
- [Database Schema](../../System/database-schema.md) - TransferApprovalRule model reference
- [Stock Transfers Guide](../../SOP/stock-transfers-feature-guide.md) - Approval workflow
- [Product Archival PRD](../Completed/product-archival/prd.md) - Similar implementation pattern

**Problem Being Solved:**
Disabled approval rules (`isActive: false`) still clutter the rule management UI. As approval workflows evolve, old rules accumulate (outdated thresholds, deprecated conditions, restructured approval chains). Full archival provides complete hiding from UI while maintaining the ability to restore if workflow needs to be reinstated.

**Relationship to isActive Flag:**
- `isActive: false` = Rule disabled but visible in UI (temporary)
- `isArchived: true` = Rule completely hidden from UI (permanent removal from active workflow)
- Both fields can coexist: archived rules inherit their isActive state for restoration

## Phase 1: Soft Delete Implementation

**Goal:** Implement archive/restore functionality for approval rules with full backend and frontend support

**Relevant Files:**
- [api-server/prisma/schema.prisma](../../api-server/prisma/schema.prisma) - TransferApprovalRule model
- [api-server/src/services/approvalRuleService.ts](../../api-server/src/services/approvalRuleService.ts) - Approval rule service
- [api-server/src/routes/approvalRulesRouter.ts](../../api-server/src/routes/approvalRulesRouter.ts) - Approval rule routes
- [api-server/src/openapi/paths/approval-rules.ts](../../api-server/src/openapi/paths/approval-rules.ts) - OpenAPI schemas
- [admin-web/src/pages/ApprovalRulesPage.tsx](../../admin-web/src/pages/ApprovalRulesPage.tsx) - Rules list UI

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests (Jest)

**Service Layer:**
- [ ] Archive rule succeeds
- [ ] Archive rule updates isArchived, archivedAt, archivedByUserId
- [ ] Restore rule clears archive fields and preserves isActive state
- [ ] List rules excludes archived by default
- [ ] List rules with archivedFilter='archived-only' returns only archived
- [ ] List rules with archivedFilter='all' returns all rules
- [ ] getRule() allows access to archived rules
- [ ] Rule evaluation excludes archived rules (only non-archived, active rules)
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation (cannot archive other tenant's rules)
- [ ] Audit trail preservation (UPDATE events for restore)

**API Routes:**
- [ ] DELETE /approval-rules/:id sets isArchived instead of deleting
- [ ] POST /approval-rules/:id/restore restores archived rule
- [ ] GET /approval-rules with archivedFilter parameter works correctly
- [ ] GET /approval-rules/:id returns archived rules (for detail page access)

### Frontend Tests (Playwright E2E)

**User Flows:**
- [ ] Archive rule from detail page (with confirmation modal)
- [ ] Cancel archive confirmation (verify no changes made)
- [ ] Use archive filter dropdown to show only archived rules
- [ ] Use archive filter dropdown to show all rules (active + archived)
- [ ] Restore archived rule from detail page
- [ ] Archived badge displayed correctly in list views
- [ ] Inactive badge displayed correctly for isActive: false rules
- [ ] Archived rules hidden by default in list view
- [ ] Archived rules accessible via direct URL to detail page
- [ ] Archive confirmation modal displays with correct messaging
- [ ] Clear archive filter resets to default state

**State Management:**
- [ ] Restored rule shows original isActive state (active or inactive)
- [ ] isActive toggle disabled when rule is archived
- [ ] Both badges shown correctly when rule is archived AND inactive

**Permission-Based UI:**
- [ ] Users with stock:transfer can archive and restore rules
- [ ] Users without stock:transfer (VIEWER) cannot see archive/restore buttons
- [ ] Archive button shown for all non-archived rules (active or inactive)
- [ ] Restore button only shown for archived rules

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Enhancement of isActive** - Archive is a stronger version of "inactive", completely hiding from UI
- **State preservation** - Restored rules retain their original isActive state (active or inactive)
- **Archive terminology** - Using "Archive" in UI instead of "Delete" to clarify it's reversible
- **Three-way filter** - Dropdown with 3 options (active-only, archived-only, all) for better control
- **Archive from detail page** - Archive action on detail page with confirmation modal (consistent with other archival features)
- **Confirmation modal** - User-friendly explanation: "This approval rule will be completely hidden from the UI and will not be evaluated in the approval workflow. All historical data will be preserved and the rule can be restored at any time."
- **Permission level** - Reusing existing `stock:transfer` permission (no new permission needed)
- **Optional tracking fields** - Including archivedAt and archivedByUserId for audit trail
- **Archived rule access** - Allow detail page access for restoration
- **Rule evaluation** - Archived rules completely excluded from approval workflow (isArchived: false AND isActive: true)

**State Combinations:**
| isActive | isArchived | Behavior |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| true | false | Active rule (evaluated in workflow) |
| false | false | Inactive rule (visible in UI, not evaluated) |
| true | true | Archived active rule (hidden, restorable to active) |
| false | true | Archived inactive rule (hidden, restorable to inactive) |

**Related Constraints:**
- TransferApprovalCondition uses `onDelete: Cascade` (conditions deleted with rule - but we archive instead)
- TransferApprovalLevel uses `onDelete: Cascade` (levels deleted with rule - but we archive instead)
- No direct foreign key constraints from TransferApprovalRecord to rules (historical approval records preserved)

**Known Limitations:**
- Archived rules remain in database permanently (not a true delete)
- Rule name not unique (multiple rules can have same name, even if one archived)
- Historical approval records don't reference rules directly (no broken references from archival)
- Both isActive and isArchived need to be checked for proper filtering

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Bulk archive/restore operations
- Scheduled permanent deletion of archived rules (after X days)
- Archive reasons/notes field (e.g., "Threshold outdated", "Workflow restructured")
- Archive history timeline (show who archived/restored and when)
- Rule usage statistics (show how many transfers matched rule before archival)
- Smart suggestions: "This rule hasn't matched any transfers in 6 months. Archive it?"
- Cascade archival warning: "This rule has 3 approval levels and 5 conditions"
- Auto-disable before archive workflow (isActive: false â†’ wait 30 days â†’ archive)
