## Overview

Enable safe custom role deletion by implementing soft delete (archive) pattern for tenant-specific roles. As organizations evolve, custom roles become obsolete (restructured departments, deprecated job titles, merged permission sets). This feature allows archiving outdated custom roles while preserving system roles (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER) and maintaining audit trails for historical role assignments.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Archive custom roles instead of hard delete (preserves audit trail)
- System roles (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER) cannot be archived (safety check)
- Filter archived roles from active views with dropdown (active-only, archived-only, all)
- Archive roles from role management page with confirmation modal
- Restore archived roles (users with roles:manage permission)

**Related Documentation:**
- [Database Schema](../../System/database-schema.md#role) - Role model reference
- [RBAC System](../../System/rbac-system.md) - Role and permission system
- [Product Archival PRD](../Completed/product-archival/prd.md) - Similar implementation pattern

**Problem Being Solved:**
Custom roles cannot be deleted when they have active memberships (UserTenantMembership) due to foreign key constraints. As organizations restructure, old custom roles accumulate and clutter the role management UI. Soft delete provides a clean way to hide obsolete roles while preserving historical role assignments and the ability to restore if needed.

**Critical Safety Requirement:**
System roles (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER) with `isSystem: true` must NEVER be archivable. These are core to the RBAC system and must always be available.

## Phase 1: Soft Delete Implementation

**Goal:** Implement archive/restore functionality for custom roles with full backend and frontend support

**Relevant Files:**
- [api-server/prisma/schema.prisma](../../api-server/prisma/schema.prisma) - Role model

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests (Jest)

**Service Layer:**
- [ ] Archive custom role succeeds
- [ ] Archive custom role updates isArchived, archivedAt, archivedByUserId
- [ ] Cannot archive system role (isSystem: true) - throws error
- [ ] Cannot archive role with active memberships - throws error
- [ ] Restore role clears archive fields
- [ ] List roles excludes archived by default
- [ ] List roles with archivedFilter='archived-only' returns only archived
- [ ] List roles with archivedFilter='all' returns all roles
- [ ] getRole() allows access to archived roles
- [ ] Role selection for memberships excludes archived roles
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation (cannot archive other tenant's roles)
- [ ] Audit trail preservation (UPDATE events for restore)

**API Routes:**
- [ ] DELETE /roles/:id sets isArchived instead of deleting (custom roles only)
- [ ] DELETE /roles/:id returns 400 for system roles
- [ ] POST /roles/:id/restore restores archived role
- [ ] GET /roles with archivedFilter parameter works correctly
- [ ] GET /roles/:id returns archived roles (for detail page access)

### Frontend Tests (Playwright E2E)

**User Flows:**
- [ ] Archive custom role from detail page (with confirmation modal)
- [ ] Cancel archive confirmation (verify no changes made)
- [ ] Use archive filter dropdown to show only archived roles
- [ ] Use archive filter dropdown to show all roles (active + archived)
- [ ] Restore archived role from detail page
- [ ] Archived badge displayed correctly in list views
- [ ] Archived roles hidden by default in list view
- [ ] Archived roles accessible via direct URL to detail page
- [ ] Archive confirmation modal displays with correct messaging
- [ ] Clear archive filter resets to default state

**System Role Protection:**
- [ ] System roles display "System Role" badge
- [ ] System roles do not show archive button
- [ ] System roles always shown in active list (cannot be archived)

**Role Selection:**
- [ ] Archived roles not shown in role picker for user membership assignment
- [ ] Active roles shown in role picker
- [ ] System roles always shown in role picker

**Permission-Based UI:**
- [ ] Users with roles:manage can archive and restore custom roles
- [ ] Users without roles:manage (VIEWER) cannot see archive/restore buttons
- [ ] Archive button only shown for active custom roles
- [ ] Restore button only shown for archived roles

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] System roles protected from archival (validation works)
- [ ] Backend tests all passing (role service tests)
- [ ] Archived roles excluded from active views by default
- [ ] Three-way archive filter working (active-only, archived-only, all)

- [ ] Archive/restore buttons only visible to users with roles:manage
- [ ] E2E tests written and passing (comprehensive Playwright tests)
- [ ] User documentation updated with archive workflows and system role protection

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Custom roles only** - System roles (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER) with `isSystem: true` cannot be archived (critical safety check)
- **Active membership check** - Cannot archive role if it has active memberships (prevents orphaned users)
- **Archive terminology** - Using "Archive" in UI instead of "Delete" to clarify it's reversible
- **Three-way filter** - Dropdown with 3 options (active-only, archived-only, all) for better control
- **Archive from detail page** - Archive action on detail page with confirmation modal (consistent with other archival features)
- **Confirmation modal** - Warning about active memberships: "This role will be hidden from your active role list. Users with this role will need to be reassigned. This action can be reversed."
- **Permission level** - Reusing existing `roles:manage` permission (no new permission needed)
- **Optional tracking fields** - Including archivedAt and archivedByUserId for audit trail
- **Archived role access** - Allow detail page access for restoration
- **Role picker exclusion** - Archived roles excluded from role selection dropdown (key UX improvement)
- **System role badges** - Visual indicator for system roles (cannot be edited or archived)

**Related Constraints:**
- UserTenantMembership.roleId references Role (foreign key)
- RolePermission uses `onDelete: Cascade` (permission mappings deleted with role - but we archive instead)
- System roles must always be available for RBAC system to function
- Role name uniqueness per tenant (archived role names still reserved)

**Implementation Options for Active Memberships:**

**Option A: Block archival (Recommended)**
- Throw error if role has active memberships
- User must reassign all users to different role first
- Safer, more explicit

**Option B: Auto-reassign**
- Automatically reassign active memberships to default VIEWER role
- More convenient but potentially dangerous (permission reduction)
- Requires audit trail of reassignments

**Decision: Use Option A** - Block archival if active memberships exist. Safer and more transparent.

**Known Limitations:**
- Archived roles remain in database permanently (not a true delete)
- Role name uniqueness still enforced even for archived roles (cannot reuse archived role name)
- Historical memberships still reference archived role (acceptable for audit trail)
- System role protection relies on `isSystem` flag (must be properly seeded)

**Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):**
- Bulk archive/restore operations
- Scheduled permanent deletion of archived roles (after X days)
- Archive reasons/notes field (e.g., "Department restructure", "Permission set merged")
- Archive history timeline (show who archived/restored and when)
- Auto-reassign workflow (safely migrate users from archived role to new role)
- Role usage statistics (show how many users currently have role before archival)
- Smart suggestions: "This role has 0 active users. Archive it?"
- Cascade archival warning: "Archiving this role will affect 15 users"
