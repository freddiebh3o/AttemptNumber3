# Stock Transfers V2: Future Enhancements

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [x] Phase 1: Transfer Templates & Reversal - **✅ COMPLETE (Implementation + Testing)**
- [ ] Phase 2: Transfer Approval Delegation
- [ ] Phase 3: Barcode-Based Bulk Receive
- [ ] Phase 4: Transfer Analytics Dashboard

---

## Overview

This document outlines the V2 enhancements for the Stock Transfers feature. These enhancements build upon the production-ready V1 feature to add advanced capabilities for power users and high-volume warehouses.

**V1 Feature Status:** ✅ Production Ready (All 8 phases complete)

**Related Documents:**
- [V1 Implementation Plan](stock_transfers_feature.md)
- [V1 Feature Guide](../SOP/stock_transfers_feature_guide.md)
- [Stock Management System](../System/stock_management.md)

---

## Enhancements Summary

This plan covers **7 selected enhancements** split into **4 phases**:

### Phase 1: Transfer Templates & Reversal
- **2. Transfer Templates** - Save and reuse common transfer configurations
- **7. Transfer Reversal** - Reverse completed transfers (return stock)

### Phase 2: Transfer Approval Delegation
- **4. Transfer Approval Delegation** - Multi-level approval workflow

### Phase 3: Barcode-Based Bulk Receive
- **8. Bulk Receive** - Scan barcodes to receive all items at once

### Phase 4: Transfer Analytics Dashboard
- **9. Transfer Analytics** - Dashboards for transfer velocity and branch dependencies
- **11. Transfer Prioritization** - Mark urgent transfers, prioritize in queue
- **12. Partial Shipment** - Ship less than approved if stock insufficient

---

## Excluded Enhancements

These enhancements are intentionally **excluded** from V2:

1. **Multi-product FIFO optimization** - Current single-transaction approach is performant enough
3. **Recurring transfers** - Complex scheduling logic better suited for V3+ or external scheduler
5. **In-transit tracking** - Requires third-party logistics API integration (scope too large)
6. **Cost override** - Violates FIFO accounting principles, risky for compliance
10. **Email notifications** - Will be implemented site-wide in separate notification system project

---

### Enhancement #2: Transfer Templates

#### What It Does

Transfer templates allow users to save common transfer configurations (source branch, destination branch, product list) for quick reuse. Perfect for recurring manual transfers like weekly stock replenishment.

#### User Story

**As a warehouse manager**, I want to:
- Save a "Weekly Retail Restock" template with predefined products
- Click "Use Template" to pre-fill a transfer request
- Edit quantities as needed before submitting
- Save time on repetitive transfer requests

#### How It Works

**Creation Flow:**
1. User creates a transfer template from scratch OR from an existing transfer
2. Template includes:
   - Template name (e.g., "Weekly Retail Restock")
   - Source branch
   - Destination branch
   - Product list with default quantities (editable when used)
   - Optional notes
3. Template saved per tenant (accessible to all users in tenant)

**Usage Flow:**
1. User clicks "New Transfer" → "Use Template"
2. Select template from list
3. Transfer form pre-fills with template data
4. User can edit quantities, add/remove products, change notes
5. Submit as normal transfer request

**Template Management:**
1. View all templates for tenant
2. Edit template (update products, quantities, branches)
3. Delete template
4. Duplicate template (create similar template)

#### Database Schema Changes

**New Table: `StockTransferTemplate`**
```prisma
model StockTransferTemplate {
  id                  String   @id @default(cuid())
  tenantId            String
  name                String   // "Weekly Retail Restock"
  description         String?  @db.Text
  sourceBranchId      String
  destinationBranchId String
  createdByUserId     String

  tenant              Tenant                 @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  sourceBranch        Branch                 @relation("TemplateSource", fields: [sourceBranchId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  destinationBranch   Branch                 @relation("TemplateDestination", fields: [destinationBranchId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  createdByUser       User                   @relation(fields: [createdByUserId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict)
  items               StockTransferTemplateItem[]

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([tenantId])
  @@index([sourceBranchId])
  @@index([destinationBranchId])
}

model StockTransferTemplateItem {
  id                 String @id @default(cuid())
  templateId         String
  productId          String
  defaultQty         Int    // Default quantity for this product

  template           StockTransferTemplate @relation(fields: [templateId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  product            Product               @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@unique([templateId, productId])
  @@index([productId])
}
```

#### API Endpoints

**Template Management:**
- `POST /api/stock-transfer-templates` - Create template
- `GET /api/stock-transfer-templates` - List templates for tenant
- `GET /api/stock-transfer-templates/:templateId` - Get template details
- `PATCH /api/stock-transfer-templates/:templateId` - Update template
- `DELETE /api/stock-transfer-templates/:templateId` - Delete template
- `POST /api/stock-transfer-templates/:templateId/duplicate` - Duplicate template

**Template Usage:**
- `POST /api/stock-transfers/from-template/:templateId` - Create transfer from template

#### Frontend Changes

**New Components:**
- `TransferTemplatesPage.tsx` - List/manage templates
- `CreateTemplateModal.tsx` - Create/edit template
- `SelectTemplateModal.tsx` - Choose template when creating transfer

**Modified Components:**
- `StockTransfersPage.tsx` - Add "Use Template" button
- `StockTransferDetailPage.tsx` - Add "Save as Template" action

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User can create template from scratch
- [x] User can create template from existing transfer
- [x] User can list all templates for tenant
- [x] User can edit template (products, quantities, branches)
- [x] User can delete template
- [x] User can duplicate template
- [x] User can create transfer from template (pre-fills form)
- [x] Template form is editable before submission
- [x] Templates are tenant-scoped (isolated)
- [x] Deleting branch cascades template deletion
- [x] Permission: `stock:write` required for all template operations

---

### Enhancement #7: Transfer Reversal

#### What It Does

Transfer reversal allows users to "undo" a completed transfer by moving stock back from destination to source. This is essential for handling mistakes (wrong branch selected, wrong quantities) or return scenarios (defective items).

#### User Story

**As a warehouse manager**, I want to:
- Reverse a completed transfer if I made a mistake
- Move stock back from destination to source automatically
- Maintain audit trail showing the reversal
- Preserve cost basis during reversal

#### How It Works

**Reversal Flow:**
1. User views a `COMPLETED` transfer
2. Clicks "Reverse Transfer" button
3. Confirms reversal with optional reason
4. System creates a **new transfer** in reverse direction:
   - Source: Original destination
   - Destination: Original source
   - Products: Same products with same quantities originally received
   - Status: Auto-approved and auto-shipped (immediate)
   - Cost basis: Same as original transfer
5. System automatically receives at destination
6. Links both transfers (original ↔ reversal)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Reversal is a new transfer** (not status change on original)
- Original transfer remains `COMPLETED` (immutable history)
- Reversal transfer is auto-approved and auto-shipped (no manual steps)
- Audit trail links original and reversal transfers
- Cost basis flows back using original costs (FIFO preserved)
- Reversal reason stored for compliance

**Reversal Constraints:**
- Only `COMPLETED` transfers can be reversed
- Cannot reverse a transfer that was already reversed
- Cannot partially reverse (all items must be reversed together)
- User must have membership in destination branch (to ship reversal)
- Reversal must occur within reasonable timeframe (e.g., 90 days)

#### Database Schema Changes

**Update `StockTransfer` Model:**
```prisma
model StockTransfer {
  // ... existing fields

  isReversal       Boolean  @default(false)  // True if this is a reversal transfer
  reversalOfId     String?                   // Links to original transfer (if reversal)
  reversedById     String?                   // Links to reversal transfer (if reversed)
  reversalReason   String?  @db.Text         // Why reversal occurred

  reversalOf       StockTransfer? @relation("TransferReversal", fields: [reversalOfId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  reversedBy       StockTransfer? @relation("TransferReversal")

  // ... existing relations
}
```

**New Audit Action:**
```prisma
enum AuditAction {
  // ... existing values
  TRANSFER_REVERSE  // Reversal created
}
```

#### API Endpoints

**Reversal Operations:**
- `POST /api/stock-transfers/:transferId/reverse` - Reverse completed transfer
  - Request body: `{ reversalReason?: string }`
  - Response: New reversal transfer (status: `COMPLETED`)

**Updated Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/stock-transfers/:transferId` - Include reversal links (`reversalOf`, `reversedBy`)

#### Service Logic

**`reverseStockTransfer(params)` Function:**
1. Validate original transfer is `COMPLETED`
2. Validate original transfer is not already reversed
3. Validate user has access to both branches
4. Begin serializable transaction:
   - Create reversal transfer (reverse direction)
   - Set `isReversal=true`, `reversalOfId=originalId`
   - Copy items with original quantities and costs
   - Auto-approve: status=APPROVED, qtyApproved=qtyRequested
   - Consume stock at destination (original destination, now source)
   - Receive stock at source (original source, now destination)
   - Set status=COMPLETED immediately
   - Link both transfers: original.reversedById = reversal.id
5. Write audit events on both transfers
6. Return reversal transfer

#### Frontend Changes

**Modified Components:**
- `StockTransferDetailPage.tsx` - Add "Reverse Transfer" button (if eligible)
- Show reversal links:
  - "This transfer was reversed by TRF-2025-XYZ"
  - "This is a reversal of TRF-2025-ABC"

**New Modal:**
- `ReverseTransferModal.tsx` - Confirm reversal with reason input

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User can reverse a `COMPLETED` transfer
- [x] Reversal creates new transfer in opposite direction
- [x] Reversal is auto-approved and auto-shipped (no manual steps)
- [x] Stock moves back from destination to source automatically
- [x] Cost basis preserved during reversal (same as original)
- [x] Original and reversal transfers are linked (bidirectional)
- [x] Original transfer shows "Reversed" indicator with link
- [x] Reversal transfer shows "Reversal of TRF-XXX" with link
- [x] Reversal reason stored and displayed
- [x] Cannot reverse a transfer that is already reversed
- [x] Cannot reverse non-COMPLETED transfers
- [x] Audit trail captures TRANSFER_REVERSE action on both transfers
- [x] Permission: `stock:write` required
- [x] Branch membership: User must be in destination branch (to ship reversal)

## Phase 2: Transfer Approval Delegation

**Goal:** Enable multi-level approval workflows for high-value or large-quantity transfers.

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days
**Complexity:** High
**Priority:** Medium (valuable for large organizations, complex implementation)

---

### Enhancement #4: Transfer Approval Delegation

#### What It Does

Multi-level approval workflow allows organizations to require multiple approvals before a transfer can be shipped. For example:
- Transfers over 1000 units require manager AND director approval
- High-value transfers (>£10,000) require finance approval
- Transfers to external warehouses require logistics approval

This ensures proper oversight for significant inventory movements.

#### User Story

**As a warehouse director**, I want to:
- Configure approval rules based on transfer value or quantity
- Require multiple approvals before high-value transfers ship
- See who has approved and who still needs to approve
- Delegate approval authority to specific roles or users

#### How It Works

**Approval Rule Configuration:**
1. Admin defines approval rules per tenant
2. Rules are condition-based:
   - Total quantity threshold (e.g., > 1000 units)
   - Total value threshold (e.g., > £10,000)
   - Specific source/destination branches
   - Product categories
3. Each rule defines required approver levels:
   - Level 1: Branch manager (existing approval)
   - Level 2: Warehouse director
   - Level 3: Finance controller
4. Approvers can be roles OR specific users

**Approval Flow:**
1. User creates transfer request (REQUESTED)
2. System evaluates rules and determines required approvers
3. Transfer shows "Requires 3 approvals: Manager ✓ | Director ⏳ | Finance ⏳"
4. Each approver receives notification
5. Approvers approve in sequence (or parallel, configurable)
6. Once all approvals obtained, status → APPROVED (ready to ship)
7. Any approver can reject (stops workflow)

**Approval Modes:**
- **Sequential:** Approvals must be obtained in order (Level 1 → 2 → 3)
- **Parallel:** All approvers can approve simultaneously (fastest)
- **Hybrid:** Level 1 must approve first, then Level 2+3 can approve in parallel

#### Database Schema Changes

**New Tables:**

```prisma
enum ApprovalRuleConditionType {
  TOTAL_QTY_THRESHOLD       // Total quantity > X
  TOTAL_VALUE_THRESHOLD     // Total value (pence) > X
  SOURCE_BRANCH             // Specific source branch
  DESTINATION_BRANCH        // Specific destination branch
  PRODUCT_CATEGORY          // Product has category X
}

enum ApprovalMode {
  SEQUENTIAL  // Must approve in order
  PARALLEL    // All can approve simultaneously
  HYBRID      // Level 1 first, then 2+ parallel
}

enum ApprovalStatus {
  PENDING     // Awaiting approval
  APPROVED    // Approved
  REJECTED    // Rejected
  SKIPPED     // Not required (rule didn't match)
}

**Update `StockTransfer` Model:**
```prisma
model StockTransfer {

  requiresMultiLevelApproval Boolean                   @default(false)
  approvalRecords            TransferApprovalRecord[]

  // ... existing relations
}
```

#### Service Logic

**Rule Evaluation (`evaluateApprovalRules(transfer)`):**
1. Query active rules for tenant, ordered by priority
2. For each rule:
   - Check if ALL conditions match transfer
   - If match, apply approval levels to transfer
3. Return required approval levels

**Approval Submission (`submitApproval(params)`):**
1. Validate user is eligible to approve this level
2. Validate previous levels are approved (if sequential mode)
3. Record approval
4. Check if all levels approved:
   - Yes → Update transfer status to APPROVED (ready to ship)
   - No → Keep as REQUESTED, update approval progress

**Frontend Flow:**
1. Create transfer → System evaluates rules → Shows "Requires 3 approvals"
2. Transfer detail page shows approval progress:
   ```
   Approvals Required:
   ✓ Level 1 (Manager): Approved by Alice on 2025-01-15
   ⏳ Level 2 (Director): Pending
   ⏳ Level 3 (Finance): Pending
   ```
3. Eligible approvers see "Approve Level 2" button

#### API Endpoints

**Approval Rules (Admin Only):**
- `POST /api/transfer-approval-rules` - Create rule
- `GET /api/transfer-approval-rules` - List rules
- `PATCH /api/transfer-approval-rules/:ruleId` - Update rule
- `DELETE /api/transfer-approval-rules/:ruleId` - Delete rule

**Transfer Approvals:**
- `POST /api/stock-transfers/:transferId/approvals/:level` - Submit approval for level
- `GET /api/stock-transfers/:transferId/approvals` - Get approval progress

#### Frontend Changes

**New Pages:**
- `TransferApprovalRulesPage.tsx` - Manage approval rules (admin only)
- `CreateApprovalRuleModal.tsx` - Create/edit approval rules

**Modified Components:**
- `StockTransfersPage.tsx` - Show multi-level approval status in list
- `StockTransferDetailPage.tsx` - Show approval progress, approve buttons
- `CreateTransferModal.tsx` - Show which rules will apply (if any)

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Admin can create approval rules with conditions
- [ ] Admin can define approval levels (who must approve)
- [ ] System evaluates rules when transfer created
- [ ] Transfer shows required approval levels
- [ ] Users can submit approvals for their level
- [ ] Sequential mode enforces order
- [ ] Parallel mode allows simultaneous approvals
- [ ] Transfer status updates to APPROVED when all levels complete
- [ ] Any approver can reject (stops workflow)
- [ ] Approval progress visible on transfer detail page
- [ ] Audit trail captures all approvals
- [ ] Permission: `transfers:manage` for rule configuration
- [ ] Permission: `stock:write` + role/user match for approval submission

## Phase 3: Barcode-Based Bulk Receive

**Goal:** Enable warehouse staff to receive transferred items quickly using smartphone barcode scanning.

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days
**Complexity:** High (camera integration, mobile UX)
**Priority:** High (major time saver for receiving)

---

### Enhancement #8: Bulk Receive with Barcode Scanning

#### What It Does

Bulk receive allows destination branch staff to receive multiple items in a transfer by scanning product barcodes with their smartphone camera. This eliminates manual quantity entry and speeds up the receiving process significantly.

**Time Savings:**
- Traditional: 5 minutes to receive 10-item transfer (find product, enter quantity, repeat)
- Barcode: 30 seconds to receive 10-item transfer (scan, scan, scan, done)

#### User Story

**As a receiving clerk**, I want to:
- Open the "Receive Items" screen on my phone
- Scan each item's barcode as I unpack the shipment
- See real-time count of items scanned
- Submit all scanned items at once
- Quickly verify I received everything

#### How It Works

**Barcode Setup (Prerequisites):**
1. Products must have barcodes stored in database
2. Add `barcode` field to `Product` model (unique per tenant)
3. Barcodes can be:
   - EAN-13 (European Article Number)
   - UPC-A (Universal Product Code)
   - Code 128
   - QR Codes
4. Admin can set barcodes via product edit screen or bulk import

**Receiving Flow (Mobile-Optimized):**
1. User navigates to transfer detail page on phone
2. Clicks "Scan to Receive" button
3. Camera permission requested (if not granted)
4. Camera viewfinder opens with scanning overlay
5. User scans each item's barcode as they unpack:
   - Beep sound on successful scan
   - Green flash confirmation
   - Item appears in "Scanned Items" list with count
6. If product not in transfer, show error: "Item not in this transfer"
7. If already fully received, show warning: "Already received X of Y"
8. User reviews scanned items:
   ```
   Scanned Items:
   - Widget A: 25 scanned (expected 25) ✓
   - Widget B: 18 scanned (expected 20) ⚠️ 2 missing
   - Widget C: 30 scanned (expected 30) ✓
   ```
9. User clicks "Receive All Scanned Items"
10. System submits receipt with scanned quantities

**Camera Integration (Web-Based):**
- Use **HTML5 MediaDevices API** (works on iPhone Safari)
- Libraries: `html5-qrcode` or `@zxing/browser` (barcode scanning)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support for better camera access
- No native app required (works in mobile browser)

**Offline Support (Future Enhancement):**
- Service worker caches transfer data
- Scan barcodes offline
- Submit when connection restored

#### Database Schema Changes

**Update `Product` Model:**
```prisma
model Product {
  // ... existing fields

  barcode      String?  // EAN-13, UPC-A, Code128, or QR code
  barcodeType  String?  // "EAN13", "UPCA", "CODE128", "QR"

  // ... existing relations

  @@unique([tenantId, barcode])  // Barcode unique per tenant
  @@index([barcode])
}
```

#### API Endpoints

**Barcode Scanning:**
- `GET /api/products/by-barcode/:barcode` - Look up product by barcode
  - Query params: `tenantId`, `branchId`
  - Response: Product details + available stock at branch

**Bulk Receive:**
- Existing endpoint: `POST /api/stock-transfers/:transferId/receive`
- No changes needed (supports multiple items already)

#### Frontend Changes

**New Components:**
- `BarcodeScannerModal.tsx` - Camera viewfinder with scanning logic
  - Uses `html5-qrcode` library
  - Shows scanned items list with counts
  - Shows expected vs scanned comparison
  - Submit button to receive all

**Modified Components:**
- `StockTransferDetailPage.tsx` - Add "Scan to Receive" button (mobile-optimized)
- `ReceiveTransferModal.tsx` - Add "Switch to Barcode Mode" button

**New Product Management:**
- `ProductDetailPage.tsx` - Add "Barcode" field to product form
- `ProductsPage.tsx` - Show barcode in table (optional column)

#### Camera Integration

**Implementation:**
```typescript
import { Html5Qrcode } from 'html5-qrcode';

// Initialize scanner
const scanner = new Html5Qrcode("reader");

// Start scanning
scanner.start(
  { facingMode: "environment" },  // Use rear camera
  {
    fps: 10,
    qrbox: { width: 250, height: 250 },
  },
  (decodedText) => {
    // decodedText = barcode value
    handleBarcodeScanned(decodedText);
  },
  (errorMessage) => {
    // Handle scan errors (optional)
  }
);

// Stop scanning
scanner.stop();
```

**Browser Compatibility:**
- ✅ iOS Safari (iOS 11+)
- ✅ Android Chrome
- ✅ Desktop Chrome (for testing)
- ❌ Older browsers (show manual entry fallback)

#### UX Considerations

**Mobile-First Design:**
- Large touch targets (60x60px minimum)
- Camera viewfinder full-screen
- Clear "Tap to Scan" instructions
- Haptic feedback on scan (vibration)
- Audio feedback (beep sound)

**Error Handling:**
- Camera permission denied → Show manual entry fallback
- Barcode not found → Show error, allow manual search
- Product not in transfer → Show error, don't add to list
- Already fully received → Show warning, allow over-receive with confirmation

**Accessibility:**
- Manual entry always available as fallback
- Voice feedback for visually impaired users (optional)
- Keyboard shortcuts for desktop testing

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Products can have barcodes stored (unique per tenant)
- [ ] Admin can add/edit barcodes on product page

## Phase 4: Transfer Analytics Dashboard

**Goal:** Provide managers with insights into transfer patterns, bottlenecks, and branch dependencies.

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 days
**Complexity:** High (data aggregation, charting)
**Priority:** Medium (valuable for optimization, not critical)

---

### Enhancement #9: Transfer Analytics Dashboard

#### What It Does

Transfer analytics dashboard provides visual insights into stock transfer patterns across the organization. Helps managers identify:
- Which branches request stock most frequently
- Which branches ship stock most frequently
- Average approval/ship/receive times
- Bottlenecks in the transfer workflow
- High-volume transfer routes (branch → branch)
- Seasonal transfer patterns

#### User Story

**As an operations manager**, I want to:
- View transfer metrics across all branches
- Identify which branches are dependent on others
- Spot bottlenecks in approval or shipping
- Optimize stock allocation based on transfer patterns
- Generate reports for executive summaries

#### How It Works

**Dashboard Sections:**

**1. Overview Cards (Top Metrics):**
- Total Transfers (last 30 days)
- Active Transfers (not completed)
- Average Approval Time (REQUESTED → APPROVED)
- Average Ship Time (APPROVED → IN_TRANSIT)
- Average Receive Time (IN_TRANSIT → COMPLETED)

**2. Transfer Volume Chart (Line Chart):**
- X-axis: Time (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Y-axis: Number of transfers
- Lines: Created, Approved, Shipped, Completed
- Shows workflow velocity over time

**3. Branch Dependency Map (Sankey Diagram or Network Graph):**
- Nodes: Branches
- Edges: Transfer routes with width = transfer volume
- Example: Warehouse → Retail #1 (50 transfers, thick line)
- Hovering shows details: "Warehouse sent 50 transfers to Retail #1 (1,250 units)"

**4. Top Transfer Routes (Table):**
- Columns: Source, Destination, Transfer Count, Total Units, Avg Time to Complete
- Sortable by any column
- Click row to filter transfers by route

**5. Transfer Status Distribution (Pie Chart):**
- REQUESTED: 15%
- APPROVED: 10%
- IN_TRANSIT: 25%
- COMPLETED: 45%
- REJECTED: 3%
- CANCELLED: 2%

**6. Bottleneck Analysis (Bar Chart):**
- X-axis: Transfer stages (Approval, Shipping, Receipt)
- Y-axis: Average time (hours/days)
- Shows where delays occur

**7. Product Transfer Frequency (Table):**
- Columns: Product, Transfer Count, Total Qty Transferred, Top Routes
- Identifies most-transferred products
- Helps optimize product placement across branches

#### Data Aggregation

**Pre-Computed Metrics (Nightly Job):**
- Run aggregation query nightly to compute metrics
- Store in `TransferMetrics` table for fast dashboard loading
- Aggregations:
  - Daily transfer counts by status
  - Average time in each status (per day)
  - Transfer counts per route (source → destination)
  - Product transfer totals

**Real-Time Metrics:**
- Active transfers count (live query)
- Recent transfers list (last 24 hours)

#### Database Schema Changes

**New Table for Pre-Computed Metrics:**
```prisma
model TransferMetrics {
  id                  String   @id @default(cuid())
  tenantId            String
  metricDate          DateTime @db.Date

  // Volume metrics
  transfersCreated    Int      @default(0)
  transfersApproved   Int      @default(0)
  transfersShipped    Int      @default(0)
  transfersCompleted  Int      @default(0)
  transfersRejected   Int      @default(0)
  transfersCancelled  Int      @default(0)

  // Timing metrics (in seconds)
  avgApprovalTime     Int?     // REQUESTED → APPROVED
  avgShipTime         Int?     // APPROVED → IN_TRANSIT
  avgReceiveTime      Int?     // IN_TRANSIT → COMPLETED
  avgTotalTime        Int?     // REQUESTED → COMPLETED

  tenant              Tenant   @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@unique([tenantId, metricDate])
  @@index([tenantId, metricDate])
}

model TransferRouteMetrics {
  id                  String   @id @default(cuid())
  tenantId            String
  sourceBranchId      String
  destinationBranchId String
  metricDate          DateTime @db.Date

  transferCount       Int      @default(0)
  totalUnits          Int      @default(0)
  avgCompletionTime   Int?     // Seconds

  tenant              Tenant   @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  sourceBranch        Branch   @relation("RouteMetricsSource", fields: [sourceBranchId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  destinationBranch   Branch   @relation("RouteMetricsDestination", fields: [destinationBranchId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@unique([tenantId, sourceBranchId, destinationBranchId, metricDate])
  @@index([tenantId, metricDate])
}
```

- Run at 2 AM daily
- Aggregate previous day's data
- Store in `TransferMetrics` and `TransferRouteMetrics` tables
- Job file: `api-server/src/jobs/aggregateTransferMetrics.ts`

**Aggregation Logic:**
```typescript
// Pseudo-code
async function aggregateTransferMetrics(tenantId: string, date: Date) {
  // Count transfers by status created on date
  const transfersCreated = await prisma.stockTransfer.count({
    where: { tenantId, requestedAt: { gte: startOfDay(date), lt: endOfDay(date) } }
  });

  // Calculate average approval time
  const completedTransfers = await prisma.stockTransfer.findMany({
    where: { tenantId, status: 'COMPLETED', completedAt: { gte: startOfDay(date), lt: endOfDay(date) } },
    select: { requestedAt: true, reviewedAt: true, shippedAt: true, completedAt: true }
  });

  const avgApprovalTime = average(
    completedTransfers.map(t =>
      t.reviewedAt ? differenceInSeconds(t.reviewedAt, t.requestedAt) : null
    )
  );

  // Store metrics
  await prisma.transferMetrics.upsert({
    where: { tenantId_metricDate: { tenantId, metricDate: date } },
    create: { tenantId, metricDate: date, transfersCreated, avgApprovalTime, ... },
    update: { transfersCreated, avgApprovalTime, ... }
  });
}
```

### Enhancement #11: Transfer Prioritization

#### What It Does

Transfer prioritization allows users to mark certain transfers as **urgent** or **high priority**, ensuring they are processed before normal transfers. This is critical for emergency stock replenishments (e.g., stock-out at retail store).

#### User Story

**As a store manager**, I want to:
- Mark a transfer request as "Urgent" when I'm running out of stock
- See urgent transfers at the top of the list
- Receive urgent transfers faster (priority processing)

#### How It Works

**Priority Levels:**
- **URGENT** - Red, top of list, requires immediate attention (e.g., stock-out)
- **HIGH** - Orange, high priority (e.g., promotional event coming up)
- **NORMAL** - Default, standard priority
- **LOW** - Gray, can wait (e.g., seasonal overstock redistribution)

**Priority Assignment:**
1. User creating transfer can set priority (dropdown)
2. User can change priority later (if status = REQUESTED or APPROVED)
3. Priority shown in transfer list and detail pages
4. Transfer list sorted by priority first, then by date

**Priority Indicators:**
- Badge color: Urgent (red), High (orange), Normal (blue), Low (gray)
- Icon: Urgent (⚡), High (⬆), Normal (—), Low (⬇)
- Email notifications (if implemented): Urgent transfers send immediate notifications

**Auto-Priority (Optional):**
- System can auto-assign priority based on:
  - Destination branch stock level (low stock → URGENT)
  - Transfer quantity (large orders → HIGH)
  - Requester role (OWNER requests → HIGH)

#### Database Schema Changes

**Update `StockTransfer` Model:**
```prisma
enum TransferPriority {
  LOW
  NORMAL
  HIGH
  URGENT
}

model StockTransfer {
  // ... existing fields

  priority      TransferPriority @default(NORMAL)

  // ... existing relations

  @@index([tenantId, status, priority, requestedAt])  // Updated index
}
```

#### API Changes

**Updated Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/stock-transfers` - Add `priority` field to request body (optional, default: NORMAL)
- `PATCH /api/stock-transfers/:transferId/priority` - Update priority
  - Request body: `{ priority: "URGENT" | "HIGH" | "NORMAL" | "LOW" }`
  - Allowed statuses: REQUESTED, APPROVED
- `GET /api/stock-transfers` - Sort by priority first, then by date

#### Frontend Changes

**Modified Components:**
- `CreateTransferModal.tsx` - Add priority dropdown
- `StockTransfersPage.tsx` - Show priority badge in table, sort by priority
- `StockTransferDetailPage.tsx` - Show priority badge, allow editing (if REQUESTED/APPROVED)

**Priority Badge Component:**
```tsx
<Badge
  color={priority === 'URGENT' ? 'red' : priority === 'HIGH' ? 'orange' : 'blue'}
  leftSection={priority === 'URGENT' ? <IconBolt size={12} /> : null}
>
  {priority}
</Badge>
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can set priority when creating transfer
- [ ] User can update priority (if REQUESTED or APPROVED)
- [ ] Transfer list shows priority badge (colored, with icon)
- [ ] Transfer list sorted by priority first (URGENT → HIGH → NORMAL → LOW)
- [ ] Transfer detail page shows priority badge
- [ ] Priority included in audit trail
- [ ] Permission: `stock:write` required to set/change priority

### Enhancement #12: Partial Shipment

#### What It Does

Partial shipment allows source branch users to ship **less than the approved quantity** if they don't have enough stock available. The remaining quantity can be shipped later (in a second shipment) or left unfulfilled.

**Example:**
- Transfer approved for 100 units
- Source only has 70 units in stock
- Source ships 70 units now (partial shipment)
- Status: IN_TRANSIT (with 30 units pending ship)
- Later, when stock arrives, source ships remaining 30 units

#### User Story

**As a source branch manager**, I want to:
- Ship what I have available, even if it's less than approved
- Track what's still pending shipment
- Ship the remaining quantity later when stock arrives
- Avoid rejecting transfers due to temporary stock shortages

#### How It Works

**Shipment Flow:**
1. Transfer approved for 100 units (qtyApproved = 100)
2. Source clicks "Ship Transfer"
3. System checks available stock:
   - If sufficient: Ship all (current behavior)
   - If insufficient: Show "Partial Shipment" modal
4. User enters qty to ship now: 70 units
5. System ships 70 units (FIFO consumption)
6. Transfer status: IN_TRANSIT
7. Transfer item shows:
   - qtyApproved: 100
   - qtyShipped: 70
   - qtyPendingShip: 30 (calculated: approved - shipped)
8. User can ship again later (additional shipment)

**Multiple Shipments:**
- Transfer can have multiple shipment batches
- Each shipment creates separate CONSUMPTION ledger entries
- Each shipment tracked with timestamp and user

**Receiving Side:**
- Destination receives items as they arrive (existing partial receipt logic)
- No changes needed on receive side

#### Database Schema Changes

**Update `StockTransferItem` Model:**
```prisma
model StockTransferItem {
  // ... existing fields

  // qtyShipped can now be less than qtyApproved (partial shipment)
  // lotsConsumed is now an array (multiple shipments)

  shipmentBatches Json?  // Array of { batchNumber, qty, shippedAt, shippedByUserId, lotsConsumed }

  // ... existing relations
}
```

**New Audit Action:**
```prisma
enum AuditAction {
  // ... existing values
  TRANSFER_SHIP_PARTIAL  // Partial shipment
}
```

#### API Changes

**Updated Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/stock-transfers/:transferId/ship` - Add optional request body:
  ```json
  {
    "items": [
      {
        "itemId": "string",
        "qtyToShip": 70  // Optional, defaults to qtyApproved
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- If `items` not provided, ship all approved quantities (current behavior)
- If `items` provided, ship specified quantities (partial shipment)

**Validation:**
- `qtyToShip` must be > 0
- `qtyToShip` + current `qtyShipped` <= `qtyApproved`
- Must have sufficient stock for `qtyToShip`

#### Frontend Changes

**Modified Components:**
- `StockTransferDetailPage.tsx`:
  - If qtyShipped < qtyApproved, show "Ship Remaining Items" button
  - Show shipment batches (if multiple shipments occurred)
- `ShipTransferModal.tsx` (new component):
  - Show available stock for each item
  - Allow editing qty to ship for each item
  - Default = min(qtyApproved - qtyShipped, available stock)
  - Submit button: "Ship X Units" (dynamic count)

**Shipment Batch Display:**
```
Shipment History:
✓ Batch 1: 70 units shipped on 2025-01-15 by Alice
✓ Batch 2: 30 units shipped on 2025-01-18 by Bob
Total Shipped: 100 of 100 units
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can ship less than approved quantity (partial shipment)
- [ ] System validates sufficient stock for qty to ship
- [ ] Transfer status: IN_TRANSIT even if not all items shipped
- [ ] Transfer item shows qtyShipped vs qtyApproved
- [ ] User can ship again later (additional shipment)
- [ ] Each shipment batch tracked separately (timestamp, user, lots)
- [ ] Shipment batches displayed on transfer detail page
- [ ] CONSUMPTION ledger entries created for each shipment
- [ ] Audit trail captures TRANSFER_SHIP_PARTIAL action
- [ ] Frontend shows "Ship Remaining Items" button if pending shipments
- [ ] Permission: `stock:write` required
- [ ] Branch membership: User must be in source branch
