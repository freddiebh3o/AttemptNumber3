## üõ†Ô∏è Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

### [Adding a New Feature](./SOP/adding_new_feature.md)
**What it covers:**
- Complete step-by-step workflow for adding a new feature (using "Suppliers" as example)
- **Step 1:** Database changes (Prisma schema, migrations, seed data)
- **Step 2:** Add permissions (RBAC catalog, role assignments, seeding)
- **Step 3:** Backend implementation (service layer, OpenAPI schemas, router, registration)
- **Step 4:** Frontend implementation (type generation, API client, page component, routing)
- **Step 5:** Testing (backend Jest tests, frontend Playwright tests)
- Checklist for ensuring nothing is missed
- Common issues and solutions

**When to use:**
- Starting a new feature from scratch
- Ensuring you follow the correct workflow
- Onboarding new developers
- As a reference during implementation

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Update schema.prisma ‚Üí migrate ‚Üí seed
2. Add permissions ‚Üí assign to roles ‚Üí seed RBAC
3. Create service ‚Üí OpenAPI schemas ‚Üí router ‚Üí register
4. Regenerate types ‚Üí API client ‚Üí page component ‚Üí routing
5. Write tests ‚Üí verify functionality
```

---

### [Debugging Guide](./SOP/debugging_guide.md)
**What it covers:**
- **Database Issues:** Migration failures, Prisma client sync, negative stock, data integrity
- **Authentication Issues:** Session cookies not set, CORS errors, permission denied (403)
- **API Issues:** OpenAPI types out of sync, request validation failures, CORS errors
- **Frontend Issues:** Component not rendering, permission checks not working
- **Performance Issues:** Slow API requests, slow frontend rendering
- **Deployment Issues:** Production build failures, database connection timeouts
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Enable debug logs, check correlation IDs

**When to use:**
- Encountering errors or unexpected behavior
- API calls failing
- Permission checks not working
- Performance problems
- Deployment issues

**Common scenarios:**
- "My session cookie isn't being set" ‚Üí Check CORS origins and cookie mode
- "I'm getting 403 errors" ‚Üí Check user's role and permissions
- "OpenAPI types are wrong" ‚Üí Restart API server and regenerate types
- "Stock levels are incorrect" ‚Üí Check aggregate vs lot sum, recalculate
- "Database migration failed" ‚Üí Check syntax, reset database, manual fix

## üìã Tasks Documentation

**Purpose:** Feature-specific PRDs (Product Requirements Documents) and implementation plans.

**Structure:** Each feature should have its own document with:
- **PRD:** Goals, requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
- **Implementation Plan:** Technical approach, database changes, API design, frontend design
- **Status:** Planned, In Progress, Completed

**Example:**
```
Tasks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_suppliers.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_purchase_orders.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_reporting_dashboard.md
```

**When to create:**
- Planning a new major feature
- Documenting complex changes
- Coordinating multi-person work

**Template:**
```markdown
