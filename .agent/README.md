## Introduction

### What is the .agent/ Directory?

The `.agent/` directory is the **central knowledge base** for this project. It serves three key purposes:

1. **System Documentation** - Living documentation of current architecture, database schema, RBAC, and domain logic
2. **Feature History** - Complete record of what features were built, by whom (which agents), and why
3. **Agent Coordination** - Work logs and portfolios for specialized sub-agents working on the system

### Why This Structure?

**Traditional Problem:**
- Flat documentation structures don't scale with agent-based workflows
- Hard to find "what did database-expert do on suppliers feature?"
- No persistent context for sub-agents to reference previous work
- Features scattered across various docs

**Agent-Based Solution:**
- **Clear separation of concerns** - System state vs. feature history vs. procedures
- **Agent portfolios** - Each agent maintains a work history
- **Feature folders** - All work for a feature collected in one place
- **Dual output strategy** - Work logged both chronologically (by agent) and contextually (by feature)
- **Persistent context** - Sub-agents can read previous agent outputs

### Key Principles

1. **System docs reflect CURRENT state** - Always up-to-date with the codebase
2. **Features are HISTORICAL** - Completed work organized by completion date
3. **SOPs are PRESCRIPTIVE** - Step-by-step guides for common tasks
4. **Agents are SPECIALIZED** - Domain experts with focused responsibilities
5. **Documentation is CODE** - Treat docs with same care as source code

## Working with Sub-Agents

### What are Sub-Agents?

**Sub-agents** are specialized AI assistants spawned by the main thread to handle domain-specific tasks. Each agent is an expert in their field with focused responsibilities.

### The 8 Specialized Agents

| Agent | Specialty | Definition |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **database-expert** | Prisma schema, migrations, multi-tenant patterns | `.claude/agents/database-expert.md` |
| **backend-api-expert** | Express routes, service layer, OpenAPI | `.claude/agents/backend-api-expert.md` |
| **frontend-expert** | React UI, Mantine components, routing | `.claude/agents/frontend-expert.md` |
| **rbac-security-expert** | Permissions, roles, authorization | `.claude/agents/rbac-security-expert.md` |
| **test-engineer** | Jest, Playwright, test coverage | `.claude/agents/test-engineer.md` |
| **stock-inventory-expert** | FIFO logic, inventory operations | `.claude/agents/stock-inventory-expert.md` |
| **integration-orchestrator** | Type sync, deployment, coordination | `.claude/agents/integration-orchestrator.md` |
| **debugging-detective** | Bug investigation, root cause analysis | `.claude/agents/debugging-detective.md` |

### How to Use Agents

**Complete Guide:** [Agents/_index.md](./Agents/_index.md)

**Handoff Protocol:** [Meta/agent-handoff-protocol.md](./Meta/agent-handoff-protocol.md)

**Quick Pattern:**
1. Identify which agent(s) needed (see capabilities matrix in Agents/_index.md)
2. Gather context documents for agent to read
3. Spawn agent with clear task, context, and output locations
4. Agent writes to BOTH locations:
   - Chronological: `.agent/Agents/{agent-name}/work/{task}-{date}.md`
   - Contextual: `.agent/Features/{status}/{feature-name}/{agent-name}.md`
5. Agent updates their portfolio README
6. Review agent output before spawning next agent

**Example Spawn Prompt:**
```markdown
Spawn database-expert to create Supplier model.

Context to Read:
- .agent/System/database-schema.md (multi-tenant patterns)
- .agent/Features/InProgress/suppliers/prd.md (requirements)

Task:
1. Add Supplier model to schema.prisma
2. Create migration
3. Update seed data
4. Document the model

Output to:
- .agent/Agents/database-expert/work/suppliers-schema-2025-01-15.md
- .agent/Features/InProgress/suppliers/database-expert.md

Update:
- .agent/Agents/database-expert/README.md (add to Recent Work)

Format:
Use template from .agent/Meta/agent-output-template.md
```

### Typical Multi-Agent Workflows

**Full Stack Feature:**
```
database-expert → rbac-security-expert → backend-api-expert →
frontend-expert → test-engineer → integration-orchestrator
```

**Bug Fix:**
```
debugging-detective → {appropriate agent} → test-engineer
```

**Database Migration:**
```
database-expert → test-engineer
```

**UI Enhancement:**
```
frontend-expert → test-engineer
```

See [Meta/agent-handoff-protocol.md](./Meta/agent-handoff-protocol.md) for detailed workflows.

### Feature Folder Structure

```
{feature-name}/
├── README.md              # Feature overview, status, key changes
├── prd.md                 # Product requirements document
└── {agent-name}.md        # Agent-specific outputs (database-expert.md, etc.)
```

---

## Agent Work Logs

**Purpose:** Track work completed by each specialized agent, organized by agent with chronological logs.

**Index:** [Agents/_index.md](./Agents/_index.md)

### Agent Portfolios

Each agent maintains a portfolio at `.agent/Agents/{agent-name}/README.md` containing:
- Agent purpose and capabilities
- Recent Work (last 10 outputs)
- Common patterns
- Related agents

### Agent Capabilities Matrix

See [Agents/_index.md](./Agents/_index.md) for complete matrix showing:
- Primary responsibilities for each agent
- Supporting roles across different tasks
- When to use each agent
- Multi-agent workflow patterns

### Dual Output Strategy

Every agent writes to TWO locations:

1. **Agent Work Log (Chronological)**
   - Location: `.agent/Agents/{agent-name}/work/{feature}-{topic}-{date}.md`
   - Purpose: "What has this agent done recently?"
   - Retention: Keep last 10 outputs

2. **Feature Folder (Contextual)**
   - Location: `.agent/Features/{status}/{feature-name}/{agent-name}.md`
   - Purpose: "What work was done for this feature?"
   - Retention: Permanent (moves with feature to Completed/)

**Why dual strategy?**
- See agent's recent work for similar tasks
- Gather all context for a feature in one place
- Easy archival (move entire feature folder)
- Portfolio building for agent improvements

- **New feature completed** → Move to [Features/Completed/](./Features/Completed/), create README
- **Agent completes work** → Update agent portfolio, save to both locations
- **Test patterns change** → Update relevant testing SOPs

### How to Update

**System Docs (architecture, database, RBAC, stock):**
1. Locate relevant section
2. Update inline (preserve structure)
3. Add new sections if introducing new concepts
4. Update "Last Updated" date at bottom
5. Cross-reference related docs if needed

**Feature Docs:**
1. When feature starts: Create folder in InProgress/
2. During development: Agents add their outputs
3. When complete: Move to Completed/YYYY-MM/
4. Create feature README summarizing work
5. Update [Features/_index.md](./Features/_index.md)

**Agent Portfolios:**
1. After agent completes task: Add to "Recent Work" (last 10)
2. Keep chronological order (newest first)
3. Archive oldest when adding 11th entry

**SOPs:**
1. Add new sections for new patterns
2. Update examples when code patterns change
3. Add issues to troubleshooting guides
4. Keep practical with code snippets

### Documentation Principles

- **Accuracy:** Outdated docs are worse than no docs. Keep current.
- **Clarity:** Use examples, code snippets, diagrams where helpful.
- **Completeness:** Cover the "what", "why", and "how".
- **Cross-referencing:** Link to related docs liberally.
- **Practical:** Focus on how developers will actually use the system.
- **Searchable:** Use clear headings, consistent terminology.
- **Maintained:** Treat docs with same care as code.

### Documentation as Code

- Documentation lives in version control
- Changes reviewed like code changes
- Documentation changes paired with code changes
- Keep docs in sync with implementation
- Update docs in same commit/PR as code change
