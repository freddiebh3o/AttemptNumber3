## What Are Dispatch Notes?

Dispatch notes are PDF documents that automatically generate when you ship a stock transfer. They provide physical documentation of what was shipped, serving as:

- **Packing slips** to include with the shipment
- **Audit records** for compliance and tracking
- **Proof of shipment** with exact quantities and costs
- **Inventory reconciliation** documents

Each dispatch note includes:
- Transfer number and shipment date
- Source and destination branch details
- Complete list of shipped items (name, SKU, quantity)
- Lot numbers for traceability
- Unit costs (FIFO-calculated)
- Your company branding (logo, colors)
- Who shipped the items and when

## When Are Dispatch Notes Created?

Dispatch notes are **automatically generated** when:
- You ship a transfer (status changes to IN_TRANSIT)
- All approved items are shipped (partial shipments don't trigger PDF until complete)

The PDF generates in the background (takes 1-3 seconds) and becomes available immediately on the transfer detail page.

## Regenerating Dispatch Notes

Sometimes you need to regenerate a dispatch note (for example, if your company branding changed or there was a data correction).

### Who Can Regenerate

**Permission required:** `stock:write` (Editor role or higher)

### When to Regenerate

- Company logo or branding updated
- Noticed an error in the original PDF
- Template was improved (better formatting, more details)

**Note:** Regenerating creates a new PDF with current data. The old PDF is replaced (not versioned).

### How to Regenerate

1. Open the transfer detail page
2. Look for **"Regenerate PDF"** button (next to "View Dispatch Note")
3. Click the button
4. New PDF generates (takes 1-3 seconds)
5. Success notification appears
6. "View Dispatch Note" now shows the new PDF

## Technical Details

### Storage

- PDFs stored in secure cloud storage (Supabase)
- Each tenant has isolated storage (you can't see other companies' PDFs)
- File naming: `TRF-2025-0001.pdf` (transfer number)
- Files persist indefinitely for audit compliance

### Security

- **Authentication required:** Must be logged in to view
- **Permission-based:** Need `stock:read` to view, `stock:write` to regenerate
- **Multi-tenant isolation:** Can only access your company's PDFs

### Performance

- PDF generation adds 1-3 seconds to shipping workflow
- Subsequent views are instant (PDF already generated)
- Download and print are standard browser operations

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I view dispatch notes for old transfers?**
A: Yes. Any transfer that was shipped has a dispatch note available. Click "View Dispatch Note" on any completed transfer.

**Q: What if the dispatch note didn't generate?**
A: Rare, but if it fails, you'll see an error message. Contact your admin to regenerate it using the "Regenerate PDF" button.

**Q: Can I customize what appears on the dispatch note?**
A: The template is standardized, but your company branding (logo, colors, name) is automatically included. Contact your admin to update branding in Settings.

**Q: Why don't I see the "View Dispatch Note" button?**
A: The button only appears after a transfer is shipped (status IN_TRANSIT or later). Transfers in REQUESTED or APPROVED status don't have dispatch notes yet.

**Q: Can destination branch users view the dispatch note?**
A: Yes. Anyone with `stock:read` permission can view dispatch notes for transfers they have access to.

**Q: Does regenerating change the transfer data?**
A: No. Regenerating only creates a new PDF from the current transfer data. It doesn't change quantities, costs, or any transfer details.

**Q: Can I delete a dispatch note?**
A: No. Dispatch notes are permanent for audit compliance. If there's an issue, regenerate it with corrected data.

**Q: How long are dispatch notes kept?**
A: Indefinitely. They're stored in cloud storage and available as long as the transfer exists in the system.
