## Creating a Transfer Request

### Step 1: Start New Transfer

1. Go to **Stock Management** â†’ **Stock Transfers** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Transfer Request** button (top right)

### Step 2: Select Branches

1. **Source Branch**: Select where the stock will come from
2. **Destination Branch**: Select where the stock will go
   - This must be a branch you're a member of
   - You're requesting stock for this branch

### Step 3: Add Items

1. Click **Add Item** button
2. Search for the product you need
3. Enter the quantity you're requesting
4. Repeat for each product you need

**Tips:**
- You must add at least one item
- You can add multiple items to one transfer
- Use the search box to quickly find products
- Quantities must be whole numbers

### Step 4: Set Priority (Optional)

Choose how urgent this transfer is:

- **URGENT**: Stock-out emergency (red)
- **HIGH**: Promotional event or high demand (orange)
- **NORMAL**: Regular replenishment (default, blue)
- **LOW**: Overstock redistribution (gray)

The source branch will see urgent transfers first when reviewing requests.

### Step 5: Add Request Notes (Optional)

Add a note explaining why you need this transfer:
- "Low stock - expecting busy weekend"
- "New product launch on Friday"
- "Redistributing excess inventory"

This helps the source branch understand your needs and prioritize.

### Step 6: Submit Request

Click **Create Transfer Request**

**What happens:**
- Transfer is created with status REQUESTED (yellow)
- Transfer number is assigned (e.g., TRF-2025-001)
- Source branch is notified to review your request
- You can view it in your transfers list under "Outbound" tab

## Using Templates

If you regularly transfer the same products between the same branches, save time with templates.

### Create from Template

1. Click **New Transfer Request**
2. Click **Use Template** button
3. Select a template from the list
4. The form pre-fills with:
   - Source and destination branches
   - Products and default quantities
5. Adjust quantities or change branches if needed
6. Add notes if needed
7. Click **Create Transfer Request**

### When to Use Templates

- Weekly restocking of retail stores
- Monthly inventory rebalancing
- Standard transfers for seasonal products

See [Transfer Templates](transfer-templates.md) for how to create and manage templates.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I create a transfer to a branch I'm not a member of?**
A: No. You can only request transfers to branches you're a member of. This ensures you're authorized to receive stock at that location.

**Q: What if I'm not sure how much I need?**
A: Request your best estimate. The source branch can approve a different quantity if needed. You can also create another transfer later if you need more.

**Q: Can I edit a transfer after creating it?**
A: You can change the priority while it's in REQUESTED status. To change items or quantities, you'll need to cancel and create a new transfer.

**Q: How long does approval take?**
A: This depends on your organization's workflow. Urgent transfers are typically reviewed first. Source branch members receive notifications of new requests.

**Q: Can I create a transfer from Branch A to Branch B if I'm not a member of Branch A?**
A: Yes, as long as you're a member of the destination branch (Branch B in this case). You're requesting stock from Branch A, not giving it away.

## What Happens Next?

After you create a transfer request:

1. Status is **REQUESTED** (yellow)
2. Source branch reviews your request
3. They either:
   - **Approve** it (with quantities they can provide)
   - **Reject** it (with a reason)
4. If approved, source branch ships the items
5. You receive the items and confirm receipt
